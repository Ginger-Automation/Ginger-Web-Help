","\n    "," This action tells Ginger which window to work on out of many running windows applications.","\n    ","\n    "," How does it work?","\n    "," When we say we want to Automate a windows application, the first question comes:","\n    "," How will Ginger identify the window that we want to automate out of all the windows running?","\n    "," The answer is simple. We would tell Ginger to Automate a specific window by using its window name as its identity. Thus, we refer to the window to automate ","\n    "," by using its window name and switching to that window before performing any other actions on it.","\n    "," ","\n    ","\n    "],["\n    "," ","To open Ginger’s Window Explorer, click on the + button as shown below.","\n    "," ","\n    "," ","\n    "," "," Click on the Explorer button.","\n    "," ","\n    "," ","\n    "," "," Then following window get displayed.","\n    "," ","\n    ","\n    ","\n    "," "," Adding Switch Window Action -","\n    "," First, select the window which we need to Automate from the Ginger Window Explorer.","\n    "," ","\n    ","\n    ","\n    "," ","Note that the selection was done manually in this case.","\n    "," To do this at run time, we need a Switch Window Action with the window name as a parameter.","\n    "," Click on the button shown below to create the activity and add it to the business flow with a single click.","\n    "," ","\n    ","‎","\n    "," ","As we proceed further with creating the actions for the automation, keep an eye on the “Activity Actions” section, where these actions will be added one by one ","\n    "," as soon as we add them.","\n    ","\n    "," For now, we can see only the action that we have added, i.e., the switch window action:","\n    "," ","\n    ","\n    "," "," Spying Elements","\n    "," Live Spy tab in the Ginger Window Explorer allows the user to spy on the elements.","\n    "," ","\n    ","\n    ","\n    "," Click on the Spy button to activate the live spy.","\n    "," ","\n    ","\n    ","\n    "," When Spy gets activated below Spying... button gets displayed.","\n    "," ","\n    ","\n    ","\n    "," On the windows application, hover over the area you need to perform an action and press and hold the control button on the keyboard.","\n    ","\n    "," Suppose if we want to click on the "," button in Skype, we hover on that button while keeping the control key pressed.

","\n    "," We need to use a locator that works for this scenario. (Ideally should be unique)","\n    ","         ","\n    "," If any parameters need to be passed in the action (like if you need to set a specific text value in a text box), they should be added in the value textbox of the ","\n    "," Ginger Window Explorer. For a button, this is not required, so we will skip that part.","\n    ","\n    ","\n    "," Once we have selected the Action and a Locator, we can click on the Run button to test it.","\n    "," (In case it fails, test again with a different locator/action)","\n    "," ","\n    ","\n    "," The test result will be displayed as follows.
