    Purpose
     The Python Plugin target is to allow executing Python scripts from Ginger as an integrative part of the Ginger test flow.
    
     Ginger Python plugin allows to:
    Configure python script execution by using a script file.
    Configure python script execution by using script content.
    
     For the above execution methods ginger python plugin offers:
    Send execution Input Values to python script.
    Get execution output values by parsing and showing console values and look for “key=value” pairs
    
     The purpose of this document is to provide step by step guide on the Ginger Python plugin way of installing and using it.
     
    Prerequisites
    Please see below the items which need to be set up on the testing environment before executing the Python plugin.
     
    .NET 7 SDK Installation
    The plugin requires .NET 7 SDK or above to be installed on the machine it is running on. Please download and install it from Microsoft Official Page.
    
    
     
       Python Installation
    Python installation is a must for the plugin to work.
    “PYTHON_HOME” environment variable system configuration is also required.
     
       Script
    The python script files need to be located on the machine on which the Python Plugin running.
    It is recommended to place the script under the Ginger Solution “Documents” folder and use relative paths to it (like “~/Documents/Scripts”) so it will work on any user machine.
     
    Install Python Plugin
        Ginger python plugin needs to be installed to the Ginger Solution to be used.
        Please follow the below steps to perform it.
     
       Add python Plugin to Ginger Solution
    
      Download and Install the latest/required Ginger version from here
      Launch Ginger and add a Solution to it
      In Solution go to Resources-> Plugins
      Click on the “Download Plugin” tab
      Select “Python” Plugin from loaded list of Plugins
      Select latest/required Plugin version
      Click on Install
    
     
     Once installation is done, shift to the “Installed” tab and confirm the ”Python” plugin appears on the tree- you will see the Plugin details on the right including its 
     embedded action types.
                   
     
                     
     
     
         Executing Python Script
     Please follow the below steps to execute the python script.
         Execute python script using an external file
    Add Business Flow or select an existing one and click on “Automate” for loading it on Automate page
    Click on Add Action button, in the loaded window go to “Plugins Actions”
    Select “Run Script file” Action

      Get Output Values from Python Flow to Ginger Flow
                 Python plugin supports getting output values from the Python Flow.
    It has been done by parsing all values which the Python flow write to the Console during execution, the parsing mechanism looks for any “key=value” pair and if it been found so the Key and Value been added to the Action Output Values list.
     
          How to Get Output Values from Python Flow to Ginger Flow
    Prepare the Python Flow Code for Sharing Output Values
    Open the Script in notepad or another Editor.
    Look for the places in code (either tested class methods or actual test methods) which have values that can be shared with Ginger during execution
    In each such place, add a “print()” line of code with the Value key name equal to the value that needs to be shared, see sample below:
    
     
     Configure Ginger Python Plugin Action to Read Output Values
    Configure any one of the Python Actions configurations
    After execution end, go to Action “Output Values” tab and see all output values which were parsed in run time
    Now you can set Validations on top of those values or pass them to Variables/Data Source or others to be used in the next Actions/other in the Ginger flow
