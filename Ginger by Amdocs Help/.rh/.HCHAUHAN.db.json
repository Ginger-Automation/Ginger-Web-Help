convert their obsolete flows containing redundant \n     actions to new flows, also it provides the ability to convert to new actions using the POM objects.\n    \n     In this document, we’ll consider the example of conversion of obsolete ASCF Driver-based flows to Java Driver-based flows. There \n     could be more such scenarios in the future but for simplicity in understanding, we will take the example of conversion of obsolete \n      ASCF flows to Java Driver.\n     Since ASCF Driver is no longer supported by Ginger and users are highly recommended to switch to Java Driver for automation, \n     the ASCF/GTB Converter will facilitate the users to automatically convert their obsolete ASCF Driver-based actions to Java Driver- \n     based ones thus, minimizing the manual effort to a great extent.\n    \n    \n    Understanding the Actions Convertor\n     The Actions Conversion window consists of mainly three sections:\n    \n    Name of Activities in the Business Flow,\n    Convertible Action Types and,\n    Conversion Configurations\n    \n     Name of Activities in the Business Flow\n    This section lists out all the activities present in the selected Business Flow regardless they are active or inactive.\n    The user needs to select the activities that he wants to convert from the grid and then, click on the View Convertible Action Types buttons.\n    \n    Convertible Action Types\n    This section enlists all the types of actions present in the selected activity by the user. The action types are shown in a grid along with their \n    Source Activities, which are the parent activities that contain that specific type of action in the activity.\n    The users can also view the Count of the action types in the selected activity i.e. number of occurrences of the action types in this activity \n    along with their parent activities.\n    Finally, we have the Target Action Type that states the action type of the newly converted actions after the conversion is done.\n        ‎\n    Conversion Configurations\n    In this section, the users can do the configuration settings for the conversion. The users can choose whether they want to add the newly converted actions to a New Activity or the Same Activity i.e. the parent activity to which the obsolete action belongs to, also it provides the ability to convert to new actions using the POM objects user can select the existing POM object.\n    The users can also set a default Target Application (TA) for the modified activities by selecting the respective TA from a list of available TAs that are present in the selected Business Flow.\n    \n    In case the flow doesn’t have the required TA (in this case, a Java platform-based) then, the user can simply minimize the Actions Flow Conversion window and add the required TA to the flow from the Solution tab. Once added successfully, the user can switch back to the Actions Conversion window and click on the Refresh button () and the newly added TA will be shown in the list of TAs.\n    The user can choose the TA from the dropdown list and then, click on the Convert button and the newly converted actions will be added to a new activity or the same parent activity, depending on the selection made by the user.\n    \n    NOTE: It’s recommended to add the newly converted actions to a New Activity rather than the Same Activity because the new actions will \n    need mapping to a different TA, in this case, a Java Driver-based TA.\n    Therefore, in a new activity, it is simpler to configure a new TA, in this case, a Java Driver-based TA. Whereas, if we choose to add new \n    actions to the same activity that is already mapped to an ASCF Driver-based TA, this will result in a conflict here. Although the conflict can \n    be resolved manually by the user, it will be easier for him/her in case of a new activity.\n     \n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              POM Selection window\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n    Figure 1 – Actions Conversion window\n    \n    \n    \n    How to use the Actions Convertor?\n                  Double click on the Business Flow to get to the page as shown below.\n                  Click on the Extra options button and select Convert Legacy Business Flow Actions into New Actions.\n    \n    Figure 2 – Actions Conversion button\n    \n    \n    Please follow the steps mentioned below:\n    \n    For example, below is a Business Flow, Web_RegressionTestingSuite, containing multiple activities from an older version.\n    Now as you can see below, the first activity consists of ‘Go to URL Action’ which is an old action.\n    \n    \n    \n                  Figure 3 – Displaying old Action\n    \n    Click on the ‘Convert Legacy Business Flow Actions into New Actions’ button under the Extra Operations.\n    \n    \n    \n    Actions Conversion wizard will be opened and will display the activities which contain legacy actions.\n    \n    Figure 6\n    \n    Now we can select the activities which we want to convert to new actions and click on the Next button, we will see a list of Convertible Actions Types along with their count listed next to their Source Activities and Target Action Type,\n    which states the Action Type to which the old action will be converted after the conversion is completed.\n    \n    \n    Figure 7\n    \n    As you can see above, the selected activity consists of:\n    \n    1 Goto URL Action and,\n    2 Generic Element Actions\n    \n    These are the obsolete actions that will be converted to UIElement Actions.\n    \n    Now, we need to select the type of actions that we want to convert. We can also select all the enlisted Source Action Types too, the selections can be made depending on the requirement.\n    After selecting the Source Action Type, we need to decide the conversion configuration. This means that we need to decide whether we \n    want to add newly converted action(s) to a New Activity or the Same Activity along\n    with the TA from the dropdown list.\n    Let’s consider both the scenarios separately here,\n    \n    \n    \n    New Activity with selected Target Application from the dropdown list\n    \n    In our example, we can select Web-App (or any other from dropdown) Target Application from the list and then, hit the Finish button, a new \n    activity with the name, New - Automate Selenium Web, will be added to your business flow\n    just below the parent activity.\n    \n    Figure 8\n    \n    We can notice that the old activity has been marked as Inactive and the newly converted activity has been set as Active.\n    \n    \n    Same Activity with selected Target Application from the dropdown list\n    \n    Now, if we select Menu Item Action and will take the default Target Application as for the Target Application for selected activity from the \n    list and then, hit the Convert button, we will see that the newly\n    converted Menu Item actions will be added to the same activity i.e. 2. Create Contact - Mandatory Information.\n    \n    \n    Figure 9\n    \n    As we can see below that the newly converted Menu Item action into UIElement actions have been added right below the source action in \n    the same activity. Also, the source actions have been marked as Inactive and thenew UIElement actions have been set as \n    Active.\n    \n    \n    Figure 10\n    \n    \n    \n    Action conversion to use the POM object\n    As we can see below that, if we select the POM object to convert the legacy actions to use the POM object then we need to select the \n    Menu Item Action as in the figure below, by selecting this we can convert the selected actions\n    to be converted to new actions which use the selected POM object. It tries to search the element (control in action) in the POM object and \n    binds the new action with the element searched.\n    \n    \n    Figure 11\n    \n    \n    \n    Figure 12\n    \n    \n    Some troubleshooting tips\n    The Actions Convertor has been tested against a number of ASCF driver-based scenarios, with different business flows from different projects but there could be some edge-cases, where it may encounter issues while conversion.\n    In such cases, we advise the users to manually configure the obsolete action causing issues like mapping of values – Locate Value, Column \n    Number or Column Title, etc. from the old action with the new UIElement Action.\n    \n    If the users still face issues with the convertor beyond their control, they are requested to share the scenarios with the Ginger Core Team so that they can look into it and fix it, as soon as possible to make the convertor more\n    robust and intuitive. Their feedback and suggestions are also welcome.\n    \n    It is recommended to choose a New Activity in the Conversion Configurations section to add the newly converted actions.\n    \n     \n

To avoid such issues this Action is created.\n    \n    The below variable types of values are made blank: -\n    Selection list\n    String\n    \n    How to Configure Action\n    Pre-requisite\n              Before performing this action, a set of variables is required to be created in the Solution.\n              The below section can be referred from Ginger Help Library to know how to create variables.\n    \n               Solution-> Business Flows-> Activity-> Actions Library-> General Actions-> Set Variable Action\n    \n    Action Operation\n     Double click on the Business flow. Click on the ‘+’ icon\n                \n    \n                On the Action Library screen go to the ‘General Actions’ tab and double click on the ‘Clear All Variables Action’\n               \n    \n                 Condition Validation Action will be added under the Activity as shown below\n    \n    \n    \n    Double click on it to see the below screen and then go to the ‘Operation Settings’ tab. Enter the condition in the Value field\n    \n    \n    \n    The Run Action button will clear all the values of the Variables described in the Introduction.\n    \n     \n

 Working with Cosmos DB\n  Ginger supports integration with Azure Cosmos DB to connect and execute DB quries for validations and fetching the data require for Automation flows.\n   \n  Current supported functionalities are:\n  \n    Configure connection string and check Cosmos connectivity\n    Run select query on Cosmos Container\n    Run record count query on Cosmos Container\n    Update existing record in Container\n    Insert new record into Container\n  \n   \n  Prerequisites\n  Cosmos DB and Container structure should be set-up and Cosmos Db should be reachable over the Internet.\n  Configure Cosmos Db\n  To Configure Cosmos Db in Ginger, go to Environments -> Your Environment -> Databases and Click on the ‘+’ Symbol. From the dropdown, select CosmosDb as shown below. To configure Connection String, click on the ‘…’ button in your Cosmos entry.\n   \n  \n    For Connection string, Please refer to below Screenshot. \n  \n                  \n  \n    You can also copy-paste the connection string from your Azure portal and at the end, append the name of the Db that you want to point to. \n    If you have multiple DBs in your Cosmos instance, you will need multiple entries in the Environments Database table. \n    Click on the Test Connection () button to test connectivity.         \n  \n  Configuring Database Action for Cosmos\n   \n  Database Action can be added from Action Library -> General action\n  For Cosmos Db, Ginger supports below operations:\n  \n    Free SQL\n    Insert\n    Record Count\n    Simple SQL One Value\n    Update DB\n  \n   \n                \n   \n  Free SQL Operation\n  The Free SQL operation lets you input any SQL query that you’d normally run on your Cosmos console. \n  Note : For SQL query to work properly, the Container name is case-sensitive. It must match with the exact name of the Container present in your Db, otherwise the API will not be able to identify the correct Container.\n   \n  \n   \n  Record Count Operation\n  Record count lets you simply enter the Container name and any where condition you wish to add, and returns the count of elements associated with that query\n   \n             \n  Insert\n  For Inserting data into Cosmos Container, you need to select the Container name in the dropdown provided, and provide the Primary Key (id in below screenshot) and Partition Key (LastName in below screenshot) values, along with the JSON that you wish to push to the Container. Please refer below screenshot.\n                   \n  Update DB\n  \n    To update entry in Cosmos db, we will leverage the Partial Update or Patch Operation provided by Cosmos. \n    For configuring this action, you need to select the Container name from the dropdown, provide Primary and Partition Key Values, \n    Then enter the Paths and the updated values of the JSON Nodes which you wish to modify. \n    For reference on how to provide Path to corresponding JSON Node, please check these links:\n  \n  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/Cosmos-db/partial-document-update\n  https://sajeetharan.com/2022/02/22/leveraging-partial-document-update-with-with-Cosmos-db-rest-operation/\n   \n  Please note that we can add more than one JSON Node if we require, we have just shown one as an example.\n   \n                \n   \n  Simple SQL One Value\n  For Simple SQL One Value, you need to simply select the Container name from the dropdown and add any condition if required, as shown below, and Ginger will internally construct the query, execute it on Cosmos and show you the results.\n   \n  \n  \n

IntroductionWeb API SOAP & Web API REST Actions support the following features:Security – ability to use certificates provided by a userAuthorization - currently added Basic authorization method using username and password.. Agent Configuration Create a new agent and select platform and driver as WebService.Go to Configurations-> Agents and click on the + button. In the Agent Wizard, enter the Name and select ‘WebServices’ in the Platform type.                      2. Configure relevant fields:SaveRequestXML, SaveResponseXML – setting Value to true will save the request files being sent and received responsesSaveXMLDirectoryPath – The path where all requests and response will be saved                                3. Test Agent – click on the ‘Test Agent Configurations’ button to make sure all the settings are correct.Make sure connection is successful:  How to configure Action            2.1 Pre-requisite A Solution should be created with the WebServices Platform.Soap UI 5.0.0 or above should be installed on the machine.SoapUI Project XML should be availableString for validation is required to verify the output if needed.                                          2.2 Action Operation                      Double click on the Business flow. In the Activity Actions, click on the ‘Add New’ button                                  In the ‘Platform Actions’ tab, select the ‘SoapUI Wrapper Action’ then Double click on the action row you selected/highlighted And it will automatically be added                                                The below screen should be displayed.  ‘XML File Location:’ use the Browse button to give the soapUI project XML file.The ‘Import XML file to Solution folder’ is used to copy the file to the Ginger Solution folder. There is an option to Add Respond XML Nodes to the Output Values.Checkbox “Ignore Report XML validation” is by default unchecked, the process will check if all the return test steps statuses are “OK” otherwise the action will be failed, if you don’t want the process to fail the action based on the statuses, please check this check box. By default, the process will run all test steps that exist on this project XML. If you want to narrow your test scope or if you need to configure test case properties please select test suite and test case, if the combo boxes are empty please press the refresh button                  From any ‘…’ the user can reach the value expression editor screen and parameterize the inputs:                Once Test Case selected the “Configure Test Case Properties” become enabled, Click it if you need to configure test case properties or place holder which will be replaced by the process on runtime  Once “Configure Test Case Properties” checked, the Radio selection and test case properties grid will become visible to the screen with all the relevant properties related to this test case, fill the ones you need and then delete all the rest (not mandatory), if you need placeholders instead so please click on Placeholders radio button and add the placeholders you need to replace on runtime.                   Entering any field from the below screenshot will replace the default value inside the project XML on runtime.                 In the screenshot below you can see the required fieldsEndpoint URL – this is the ‘endpoint ‘ URL where the request is being sent (same as in SOAP UI)If custom network credentials are required to access the endpoint URL (for example Username = so, Password=sa), a radio button  can be marked as ‘Custom’ and then 3 additional fields will be visible allowing the user to populate: username, password, and domain SOAP Action – This allows customizing the Action header in the request (if required, or can be used to identify different actions or index them).‘Do not Fail Action on Bad Response’ - when a checkbox is marked no validation will be done on the response code (useful for negative testing).‘Request Headers’ – by clicking on the ‘+’ sign (#6) the user can add a field that is required in the request e.g. token, in the case of adding a token the values should be as follows:Header = ‘Token’ (or as required per specifications).Value  =  the token value .                                If you need to configure the system, global, or project properties you shell do it in the below grids.                  Run Action.After running the action “Open Execution Output Directory” button will become enabled, click it if you want to see all the generated output files.        All the relevant data (Request, Respond, Message, Properties, Output Properties, etc..) will  be generated at the Output values grid, to validate the data you can add expected value fields just click on the “…” button and fill your expected behavior here are some examples:                    a. If you want to see if some data got on the response using “Actual contains the string”        b. If you want to see what is the index of a specific text inside the response use “Get Inner String Index”.

Properties, etc..) will be generated at the Output\n    \n                      values grid, to validate the data you can add expected value fields just click on the “…” button and fill your expected behavior\n                       here are some examples:\n                        \n        ‎\n    \n                       If you want to see if some data got on the response using “Actual contains the string”\n                      \n    \n                    If you want to see what is the index of a specific text inside the response use “Get Inner String Index”.\n                     \n    \n                    Security Configurations:-\n                    Authorization – allows using the authorization method.\n                     \n    \n                     Web API Rest Action:-\n

     In the screenshot below you can see the required fields\n    Endpoint URL – this is the ‘endpoint ‘ URL where the request is being sent (same as in SOAP UI)\n    If custom network credentials are required to access the endpoint URL (for example Username = so, Password=sa), a radio button can be marked as ‘Custom’ and then 3 additional fields will be visible allowing the user to populate: username, password, and domain\n    ‘Do not Fail Action on Bad Response’ - when a checkbox is marked no validation will be done on the response code (useful for negative testing).\n    ‘Request Headers’ – by clicking on the ‘+’ sign (#6) the user can add a field that is required in the request e.g. token, in the case of adding a token the values should be as follows:\n    Header = ‘Token’ (or as required per specifications).\n    Value = the token value .\n    Request Type: populate request type per requirement\n    **Note: GET/DELETE Requests do not require a request body\n          \n    HTTP Version – HTTP protocol version (mostly used Version 1.1):\n          \n    Response content Type – encoding of the response the user expects to receive:\n          \n    Cookie Mode:\n    Don’t use cookies – the platform will not record nor send cookies.\n    Use Fresh Cookies – the platform will retrieve the cookies from the response and store them, for example storing the cookies from a login step.\n    Use Session Cookies – will use previously-stored cookies, for example, if a login step is required then the cookies retrieved from the login step will be used\n          \n    \n          \n    \n          From any ‘…’ the user can reach the value expression editor screen and parameterize the inputs:\n          \n    \n         Request Body:\n        In this section, the user can define the body of the message\n    Radio button selecting input type: free text or from a file.\n    **Note file types are : JSON, XML,txt.\n    Body content Parameters – ability to replace keys with values per definition\n    Body content Type – request encoding\n       \n    \n         \n    \n    \n     Security Configurations:\n     This section allows the user to configure security settings:\n     \n    \n    SSL Certificates :\n    This area allows adding a custom SSL certificate to the request, default the platform Accepts all Certificates,\n    When the ‘Custom’ radio button is selected 2 fields become visible, Certificate Path & Certificate Password ( not mandatory), and \n    the user can browse for the certificate or pass its path in a variable.\n    \n    \n    Security Type – as mentioned in the introduction the user can select the security protocol per system requirements from a drop-down list\n    \n    \n    Authorization – allows to use of different authorization methods:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Output Section\n    If the actions successful the output values will be populated with :\n    Response code, headers, full response, parsed response

 \n    \n      ‎\n    Description\n    This guide will explain how you can build automation flow for mobile applications using Ginger flow creation tools.\n    \n    Pre-requisite\n    Configured Mobile Target Application\n    Configured Business Flow which mapped to the Mobile Target Application\n    Configured and working mobile Agent\n    Mobile native/hybrid/web application to automate\n    \n    Start Mobile Agent\n    Follow below steps for starting the Mobile Agent:\n    Add Business Flow and add the Mobile target application to it\n    Shift to Automate page for the specific Business Flow\n    Select the added Appium Agent to be mapped to the Mobile Target Application\n    Start the Agent by clicking on the “Start” button\n    Mobile device window will launch (unless disabled on the Agent configurations) and show the device loading and then it screenshots\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Add Device Control Actions to Automation Flow\n    By using the “Mobile Device Action” user can control the device or add device control actions to his automation flow, steps:\n    Open the “Add Actions” panel\n    Select “Actions Library”\n    Select “Platform Actions”/ ”Mobile Device Action”\n    Double click the Action for adding it to the selected Activity Actions list\n    Double click the Action to get into it “Operation Settings”\n    Select the operation to perform\n    Click on “Run Action”\n    The operation will be performed on the device and impact will be visible on the mobile device window\n    \n    \n    Create Flow using Explorer\n    The Explorer tool allows users to explore the current viewed mobile application page, select the element/control needed to be automated and attach proper action to it, by that, Action by Action, the user can build the automation flow.\n    \n    Launch Window Explorer\n    Follow the below steps for opening the Explorer tool:\n    \n      Make sure mobile Agent is started\n      Reach to the mobile application page you want to automate\n      Open the “Add Actions” panel\n      Select the “Explorer” option\n      Explorer tool will be opened inside the panel\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Select Element via Screenshot\n    The screenshot option is the easiest way to select an element to be automated, follow the below steps for using it:\n    Make sure the page to automate is loaded on the device\n    Refresh Explorer Screenshot by clicking on the “Refresh Page” button\n    Click on the “Screenshot” tab\n    Go over the screenshot image and Click on the element/control which you want to automate\n    After few seconds the explorer will identify the element control which mouse was pointing on and the element details will be loaded into the “Selected Element” section\n    Selected element also will be highlighted on the screenshot\n    \n    \n    Select Element via Page Source\n    Page Source will show the XML (for native/hybrid apps) and HTML (for Web apps) which behind the currently loaded page on the device, the user can select an element by picking one of the nodes, steps:\n    Make sure the page to automate is loaded on the device\n    Refresh Explorer Screenshot by clicking on the “Refresh Page” button\n    Click on the “Page Source” tab\n    Review the loaded XML/HTML\n    Select the node related to the control you want to automate\n    Details of the selected control will be loaded into the “Selected Element” section\n    \n    \n    \n    Select Element via Grid View\n    Grid View will show the list of elements/controls that exist on the loaded application page on the device for the user to select from, steps:\n    Make sure the page to automate is loaded on the device\n    Refresh Explorer Screenshot by clicking on the “Refresh Page” button\n    Click on the “Grid View” tab\n    Filter Elements window will be shown for the user to select the type of UI controls to filter by, user should select which type of controls he requires and click “Search” (it is recommended to use the filter for faster controls scanning process)\n    All found elements/controls will be shown in a list\n    Select the required element from the list\n    The selected element details will be loaded into the “Selected Element” section\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Add Action for Selected Element\n    Once element/control was selected using the “Screenshot”/ “Page Source” / “Grid View” tools, all of its details will be shown in the “Selected Element” section.\n    Element details will be:\n    Properties- a collection of information details Ginger collected for the specifically selected element, like Type, size, location, etc.\n    Locators- list of locators Ginger captured to be used for locating this element in flow execution time\n    Action- will include the possible operations that can be performed on the selected element\n    Steps for adding Action for the specifically selected element:\n    Click on the Action tab\n    Select/set the proper locator and value to be used\n    Select the operation to be done\n    In case relevant, set the value to be used\n    Click on “Run” for testing the operation from the Explorer

top.\n                 Multiple DBs can be configured and used for the same testing Purpose on Ginger.\n    \n    Recording Unix based Action\n    Recording Unix based actions\n    \n    \n                   The above window will be opened upon launching the Unix agent, in this case, the Unix machine is configured with IP 10.122.113.194 which is    \n                 a Rasp PI machine.\n    \n                   Once the Agent comes up, click on the Record button to start recording\n                   \n                  \n    \n                  On the above window, it clearly shows what all the actions performed on the Unix window is been recorded as individual actions on a Ginger        \n                tool.\n                 The same steps needed for testing Unix based projects can be recorded and executed on Ginger.\n                  We can set up a pre and post waiting time as needed on a Ginger tool.\n                  In case of developing customized scripts for the Project, the Output of each such script should have a pre-defined start and end display lined on    \n                the output.\n                 FTP files from and to services are as well available with all other Unix commands.\n                The ginger tool as of now have pre-defined Unix Building block scripts for basic operations like, is file exist, move the file, copy a file, delete \n    files.\n                There is no Ginger tool pre-defined experience are needed for using this tool.\n                The Interface is user friendly and look and feel exactly like a Unix Xterm or putty Unix window.\n                If multiple Unix servers need to be used to accomplish the testing can be achieved using the multiple server configuration.\n                The business flow will have the same sequences of commands on the same servers as Manual testing performed.\n     \n    \n                Limitations\n               Unix session cannot be left ideal for more than 5 minutes, will terminate the connection at the backend\n    \n                When dealing with multiple servers, each unit of work on the server by server needs to be completed before going to another server as we

\n     \n     \n     \n    \n      ‎\n    Description\n            These steps will explain how to work with Ginger Java Driver on any Java application OMS, CRM, Java, and widgets (Web embedded in \n    java application).\n             Java Agent offers:\n    \n                                  Automate Java Application\n                                  Automate Web Embedded Widgets\n    \n    Pre Requisites\n    Latest Ginger version.\n    JDK version 1.6_29 and up installed on the machine\n     \n    Configure solution to work with Java Driver\n    Add Java Agent to the Solution\n    Right-click on Agents and Add a new Agent.\n    \n    \n    Add name and target platform type.\n    \n    \n    Add Java to the target application\n    Click on the solution name.\n    \n    \n    Click on the business flow and verify that the target application is JavaApp.\n    \n    \n    Launch your Java application.\n    While using the launch java application action you will fire your java application and attach the Agent to the application.\n    Verify activity target application\n    \n    \n    \n    Configure Java Launch application Action\n    This action will enable you to:\n    Launch java application and attach the agent for using java driver to automate your application.\n    Attach the agent to running the Java application.\n    launch your java application without attaching the agent (use if u are using other agents to automate your application)\n    \n    Add new action by clicking the add action button.\n    Move to the General action tab and select the “Launch Java application”.\n    \n    \n    Edit launch java application action.\n    \n    \n    Java Version Path – Used for selecting the path for JDK location, you can select the first option if the JDK is set in your environment variable or the second option if the JDK is located in a different location on the machine. In any case, JDK is a must to run this action.\n    Launch Java Application – check this option if you want both to launch the java application and attach the agent. You can also use this Action just for attaching the agent to an already running Java application by unchecking this section.\n    Java Application Path – Add the application location is you are using to run CRM, add the full domain location for the JNLP.\n    Use the “Add Parameter to Launch Application With” button if u need to launch your application with a parameter like a user name.\n    \n    \n    \n    Wait for Java Application Window – Add the title of the window that you are expecting to be open once your application is launched and the time to wait for it (sec).\n    Attach Ginger Java Agent – use this to attach the agent to the application, by default the location of the agent is located in the ginger folder. You can also change the port if 8888 is being used by a different program.\n    Notice:\n    Java Launch Action need to be on Separate Activity it can’t be with Other\n    Action, as u can see below activity 1 holed only one action in activity 2\n    \n    We will handle the Login window.\n    \n    \n    \n    Working with Java Agent on Java Application\n    Working with Window Explore\n    Window Explorer will enable you to identify objects on the screen, add locators (Xpath, id, etc.) for the object, and actions that can \n    be done (set, get, validate, etc.).\n     \n    Once the application is up and running you can start the agent and Window Explore\n    Start the Agent:\n    \n    \n    Start the Window Explore:\n    \n    \n    \n    Once Window Explore is up select the application window title that needs to work on.\n    \n    \n    Add switch window action to set the focus on the window we want to work on, once you will click on this button “Switch Window” action will be added to the activity.\n    \n    \n    Once you add the switch window action u can Edit it and add “Sync Time” which means how much time\n    To wait for the window to come up.\n    \n    \n    You can also switch the view from tree View to Grid View by clicking on this Button.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Working with Spy\n    Click on the spy icon\n    \n    \n    Once Clicked on the spy button move your cursor to the element you want and press on Ctrl,\n    Once the element is found all details will be available.\n    For Example, if you want to work on the First Name text box:\n    \n    \n    Text box we want to work on, move your cursor to First name, and press on Ctrl.\n    Actions – these are all the actions that available for this control Set, get, Validate, etc...\n    Locators – this is how we are locating the element in this case we have ByName or by Xpath\n    We recommend working with Xpath.\n    Value – value to set on the text box.\n    Playback – once setting the value you can test the action.\n    Add to Activity – Add this Action to the flow in Ginger.\n    This is the way we are working with all elements, Drop Down list radio Button Check box tables, etc.\n    \n    Working with Widgets (Web Embedded)\n    Widgets are Web pages that Embedded in CRM \\OMS running on the JExplore process,\n    We are handling it by injecting java scripts into the web page and that enables us to interact with the page.\n    \n    Open window explores refresh the window list and select the window where the web Page is embedded.\n    \n    \n    \n    Click on the switch window action and add it to the activity\n    \n    \n    To get the elements to window explore we need to inject the JS into the page\n    Click on Grid View.\n    \n    \n    In the search box type JE and find the Jexplorer object in the grid select locator as Xpath and\n    Add the action to the activity\n    \n    Once Done with all activities above you can start working with the spy\n    To add the actions.\n    \n    \n    \n    Activity that works with widgets action should be in this order\n    \n    \n    Appendix:\n    Working with IFRAME (Widgets)\n     There are web pages that the content of the page is inside IFRAME so to handle that\n     We need to add Switch Frame action.\n    Once we add the Switch window and JExplorer Actions we need to add the Switch Frame action\n    \n    \n    \n    This is how IFRAME activity IFRAME should be handled\n    \n    \n    \n    Working With GTB and Java Driver\n    Use Different Ports, verify that you are not using the same port on GTB and Java Driver\n    Check your GTB port in this case it is 9999\n    \n    \n    So when you use launch java application action check that you are not using the same port\n    \n    \n    \n    On the java launch application action turn off the “show ginger Agent console” option.\n    \n    \n    Use different activities for java Driver and GTB\n    \n    Using Wait for Idle action on Java Application\n    Once we are adding Action like Click, we have the option to select wait for Idle,\n    Wait for Idle Enable you to set the interval and timeout to check if the application is done with processing all events and idle to \n    proceed with the next actions.\n    \n    \n    \n    Using Smart Sync Action on Java Application\n    Smart Sync will help you sync between the Automation steps and the application\n    We have 2 types:\n    WaitUntilDisaper – set wait time and check until element disappears.\n    WaitUntilDisplay – set wait time and Check until an element is Displayed.\n    \n    Click on Add new Action.\n    From the list of actions select “Smart Sync Action”\n    \n    \n    Click on the window Explore Icon and Add your element\n    Set the Action Type\n    Set Wait time\n    \n    \n    Set Date of Birth on CRM screen using Java Driver\n    \n     While setting and Date-type field on the CRM, we need to configure our Edit Java Element Action as per the highlighted fields shown in the \n     screenshot below\n                  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n

To do so:Open Putty genLoad the already generated private key (.ppk) by clicking on the “load” button                            After loading the private key, select “Export OpenSSH Key” option from the tab “Conversions”.              Save this Open ssh format private key in a file.Now, use this private key at all the source servers by pasting it under “id_rsa” file under “.ssh” directory for the user.Make sure the file “id_rsa” has permissions of 600 (only write & read permissions for the owner) Note:Also, make sure the home directory of the user doesn’t have write permissions for groups & others.   Note: We have to manually update the private key in all the source servers  How to Create PrivateKey for RSA Bypass? Generate a private public key set using putty key generator software   Store the private key using “Save private key” option. Copy the text from “Public key for pasting into ssh….. “ box and save the content as  public  key .   Log into your unix box using RSA token. Check if  .ssh directory is already created , if it is not there create the directory using Command : mkdir .sshChange permissions using commandCommand : chmod 710  .sshIn case the directory is already there just change the permissions. Now go inside .ssh directory  and check for authorized_keys file. If the file is there open it in vi mode and paste the content of public key inside it , change its permissions to 750.If not then create authorized_keys file, change its permission and open the file in vi mode and  add the content inside it  save it and quit the file.Command : touch  authorized_keysChange permissions using commandCommand : chmod 750  authorized_keys   Once the setup is done every time we log in we need to upload  the Private key(.ppk) into putty session  as shown below.  Note:  In order to SSH connection work your home directory(i.e the folder under which .ssh is present)  should never have 777 permissions.

Ginger Remote Web Driver\n     \n     \n    Contents\n    What is Selenium-Grid?\n    \n      When to Use it?\n      Create New Solution\n    \n    Running Selenium Grid\n    \n      Configuring Selenium Grid Agent\n      Starting the Hub and Nodes\n      Checking console\n    \n     \n     \n    ‎\n      What is Selenium-Grid?\n         Selenium-Grid allows you to run your tests on different machines against different browsers in parallel. That is, running multiple tests at the             same time against different machines running different browsers and operating systems. Essentially, Selenium-Grid supports distributed test            execution. It allows for running your tests in a distributed test execution environment.\n     \n         When to Use it?\n            There are two reasons why you might want to use Selenium-Grid.\n    To run your tests against multiple browsers, multiple versions of browsers and browsers running on different operating systems.\n    To reduce the time it takes for the test suite to complete a test pass\n     \n       \n     \n              Information on Selenium Grid can be found at:\n              http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/07_selenium_grid.jsp#\n              https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Grid2\n              http://www.guru99.com/introduction-to-selenium-grid.html\n     \n             Create New Solution\n                    Default Ginger Data Source will be added to every new solution with the Name “GingerDataSource”. The MDB file for the Data Source                       will be copied to the Data Sources Folder of the Solution in the File System.\n     \n     \n             Running Selenium Grid\n             Configuring Selenium Grid Agent\n     \n    Go to Configurations Tab-> Agent and click on the ‘+’ button as shown below.\n    \n     \n    In the below wizard enter the Agent name. Select the Platform type as Web and Driver Type as SeleniumRemoteWebDriver.\n    Click on the Next button\n     \n     \n    On the Selenium Grid Hub field enter the IP where you wants to configure your hub, if you running your hub on your local machine you can leave it untouched with the default value otherwise specify your hub IP and port and make sure to keep it with the same format HTTP://<IP>:<Port>.\n      \n     \n    On the Browser Name field, select the specific browser you want the agent to run on.\n    Note: Safari agent can be executed on Mac only.\n    Note: Edge can be installed on Windows 10 only.\n    Browser Version (Optional) – if not specified it will refer to any.\n    On the Platform field select the specific Platform you want the agent to run on.\n    Node for all will create a generic node for all browsers available in the selected platform.\n     \n               Starting the Hub and Nodes\n    After configuring your agent, click on both Create Hub Installation package and Create Node Installation package.\n    \n     \n    Once clicked a new Dialog box will be started with both Zips files, extract them on your local or the remote machine.\n    Start hub by executing the starthub.bat, leave the window open for your execution.\n    \n     \n    Start the node by executing the startnode.bat file on your local or your remote machine and leave the window open for your execution.\n    \n     \n    This will raise a generic node that fits up to 5 instances from any of the chosen browsers.\n    The Node is being executed with a Random Port, it might be that the port is already taken, if this is the case you can simply create a new node by clicking the node button and execute the new startnode.bat file.\n    \n    If you wish to execute the test on more Machines/Browsers you need to create new nodes by clicking the Create node installation package and executing the new startnode.bat file.\n    \n     \n               \n               Checking console\n    After starting the hub and nodes you may switch to the Console tab to check for your hub and node status.\n    \n     \n    Return to the Configuration tab and click on Test Agent Configuration button, expected result – the browser Instance is started and the success message is pop upped.\n    \n     \n    Map your web target application to your new agent and execute your test.\n     \n    \n      Note: If you wish to execute multiple browsers in parallel you need to configure one agent for each browser.\n      Note: Safari configuration has few more steps:\n    \n    Download Safari driver from http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/\n    Open the driver with Safari and do to SafariPreferences  check the Show Develop menu checkbox  Go to Develop and click Allow Remote Automation\n     \n

What is BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)BDD is a set of best practices for writing great tests. One of the key things BDD addresses is an implementation detail in tests. Behavior-Driven Development addresses this problem by showing you how to test, focusing on testing behavior, and not implementation What is Gherkin Language              Gherkin is a line-oriented language that uses indentation to define structure. Line endings terminate statements               (called steps) and either spaces or tabs may be used for indentation. (We suggest you use TABS for portability.)               Finally, most lines in Gherkin start with a special keyword: (more details in the section: 5)Key Words include (Feature, Scenario, Given, And, Then, When, But) Seamless integration from BDD Gherkin to Ginger Automation              The Ginger Automation tool now can allow users to write scenarios and Ginger will seamlessly turn these               scenarios into Automation Activities.              Gherkin – Introduction LAYOUT – Gherkin in Ginger               In the Solutions Tab, under documents, selecting a <file>.feature will allow you to write scenarios using Gherkin               language in Ginger. Fig 2.1                                  LAYOUT – Gherkin “Compile” to Automation               Once you have your scenarios wrote out, you can click the “Compile & Optimize” button and Ginger will convert                your scenarios into Ginger as Scenarios and Steps. Fig 2.2.1                               The Compile tab is used to do the following: Clicking “Compile & Optimize” will refresh the Gherkin. feature file into Ginger. Anytime any changes are done in the .feature file, you will need to click the button to allow the changes to be reflected into Ginger. If you select a converted Scenario or Step row, it will highlight in both the .feature file and in the Scenario or Step row. This will allow quick navigation to and from converted scenarios/steps to the actual Gherkin code line. All tags will be shown where you utilized them. Tags will help organize your scenarios for what area these scenarios are for.(Fig 2.2.1)                LAYOUT – Gherkin “Optimize” to Automation                Once you have “Compile & Optimize” on the “Optimized” tab, you can see how many times you have reused the                 same steps. Fig 2.3.1                             The Optimize tab is used to do the following:Clicking “Update Business Flow” will refresh the Gherkin. feature file into Ginger Business Flow. Anytime any changes are done in the .feature file, you will need to click the button to allow the changes to be reflected into Ginger. Users will be allowed to see how Optimized they wrote their scenarios. They can view how many times they reused the same steps. This also allows automation developers to know where to start on their automation. Starting to develop those steps that are utilized the most. Users will also be able to check the automation status of each step.(Fig 2.3.1)       IMPORT – Gherkin File to BF                The Ginger Automation Tool can import any Gherkin <file>.feature into Ginger and convert them to a                 Automation Business Flow in Ginger. IMPORT – Gherkin .feature file to BF               In the Solutions Tab, under Business Flows (we suggest organizing with folders like in Fig 3.1.1), Import InstructionsRight-click on Business Flow or on the Folder you want to create the BF in, and in the dropdown select “Import” à “Import Gherkin Feature”. Fig 3.1.1 The File selection window will show, select “…” to browse windows location for your .feature file and click “Open”. Fig 3.1.2 You will be able to review the Gherkin file in the preview before selecting “Import”. Fig 3.1.3 àthen select “Generate Business Flow”(Fig 3.1.1) (Fig 3.1.2)              (Fig 3.1.3)                 IMPORT – Gherkin Business Flow creation from.Feature file                       After importing the Gherkin .feature:       Generate Business Flow instructions from Gherkin FileYou will be given a chance to REVIEW the compiled Scenarios and Steps you just imported. (fig 3.2.1) If you are want to proceed to create a Business Flow you can click “Generate Business Flow” (fig 3.2.1). If you see “Update Business Flow” then the Business Flow already exists, and you can update the existing flow.                    This will create a business flow INSIDE the folder that you originally right-clicked and selected import.                      (fig 3.2.2)                   (Fig 3.2.1) (Fig 3.2.2)  IMPORT – Gherkin Optimized Activities to Automation Scenarios in Ginger                     If you are creating your scenarios using Gingers Gherkin TextEditor;                     After you have completed your new .feature:Optimized ActivitiesYou learned in sections 2.1 – 2.2 how to compile and view the optimized activities Fig 2.3.1.If your Business Flow does not exist you will see in the optimize tab “Generate Business Flow”. Fig 3.3.1This will create your Gherkin Business Flow as shown in Fig 3.2.2. OPTIMIZED ACTIVITIES – Gherkin BFs Overview              The Ginger Automation Tool can now support Gherkin BDD Business Flow, utilizing the optimization of our                 Automation and integrating optimized activities.Optimized Activities – Gherkin Business Flow Structure                   In the Solutions Tab with Gherkin Business flow selected, or having your Business Flow in the Automate Tab                    you can see the BDD Gherkin Optimized Activities, Gherkin Business Flow StructureThe Activities Group “Optimized Activities” is the inactive Activities (scenarios) that utilize the “Optimized Activities” activity group to create your scenarios. Fig 4.1.1 The unchecked “Active” column in activities is intentional, they are used to create scenarios from the optimized activities. You will also notice that each of the inactive activities will belong to the Activity Group “Optimized Activities”  Fig 4.1.1 The associated. Feature File is located in the External ID and will give the physical location of the file.

GHERKIN – Language DetailsIf you do not know what Gherkin is, below is a summary.Gherkin is the language that Cucumber understands. It is a Business Readable, Domain Specific Language that lets you describe software's behavior without detailing how that behavior is implemented. Gherkin serves two purposes — documentation and automated tests.You can view the in-depth details of the language in the following sections. GHERKIN – Language SyntaxLike Python and YAML, Gherkin is a line-oriented language that uses indentation to define structure. Line endings terminate statements (eg, steps). Either spaces or tabs may be used for indentation (but spaces are more portable). Most lines start with a keyword.Comment lines are allowed anywhere in the file. They begin with zero or more spaces, followed by a hash sign (#) and some amount of text.The parser divides the input into features, scenarios, and steps. When you run the feature the trailing portion (after the keyword) of each step is matched to a Ruby code block called Step Definitions A Gherkin source file usually looks like this 1: Feature: Some terse yet descriptive text of what is desired 2:   Textual description of the business value of this feature 3:   Business rules that govern the scope of the feature 4:   Any additional information that will make the feature easier to understand 5:  6:   Scenario: Some determinable business situation 7:     Given some precondition 8:       And some other precondition 9:     When some action by the actor10:       And some other action11:       And yet another action12:     Then some testable outcome is achieved13:       And something else we can check happens too14: 15:   Scenario: A different situation16:       ... First-line starts the feature. Lines 2–4 are unparsed text, which is expected to describe the business value of this feature. Line 6 starts a scenario. Lines 7–13 are the steps for the scenario. Line 15 starts the next scenario and so on. GHERKIN – Feature IntroductionEvery .feature file conventionally consists of a single feature. A line starting with the keyword Feature followed by free indented text starts a feature. A feature usually contains a list of scenarios. You can write whatever you want up until the first scenario, which starts with the word Scenario (or localized equivalent; Gherkin is localized for dozens of languages) on a new line. You can use tagging to group features and scenarios together independent of your file and directory structure. Every scenario consists of a list of steps, which must start with one of the keywords Given, When, Then, But or And. Gherkin Editors treats them all the same, but you shouldn’t.Feature ExampleFeature: Serve coffee  Coffee should not be served until paid for  Coffee should not be served until the button has been pressed  If there is no coffee left then money should be refunded Scenario: Buy last coffee  Given there are 1 coffee left in the machine  And I have deposited 1$  When I press the coffee button  Then I should be served a coffee In addition to a scenario, a feature may contain a background, scenario outline, and examples. Respective keywords (in English) and places to read more about them are listed in the next section: 5.4 GHERKIN – Language Key WordsBelow are the Gherkin Key Words, if you want more information please click the associated link in the More Info.KeyWord Table with links for additional info if needed.keywordlocalizedmore info, seename‘English’ native‘English’ encoding‘UTF-8’ feature‘Feature’Feature Introductionbackground‘Background’Backgroundscenario‘Scenario’Feature Introductionscenario_outline‘Scenario Outline’Scenario outlinesexamples‘Examples’ / ‘Scenarios’Scenario outlinesgiven‘Given’Given-When-Thenwhen‘When’Given-When-Thenthen‘Then’Given-When-Thenand‘And’Given-When-Thenbut‘But’Given-When-Then GHERKIN – Writing Scenarios Best PracticesWe suggest using indentation with spaces to organize your scenarios in your feature file. File Organization You can see how we organized our feature files on an application level with folders shown in Fig 5.5.1(fig 5.5.1)Step Optimization for Reusability We also suggest using what has already been developed in the repository. If an activity(Line) has already been developed it will show in the Line helper shown in Fig 5.5.2. While typing the helper box will give you a list of automated steps to choose from. Fig 5.5.2If your step does not exist yet, we STRONGLY recommend using a step line that can be reused. For example, if your step is to enter a value in a text box, use the same line verbiage exactly. Do not reword the line. This will allow us to reuse the same step. Gherkin – TextEdtor for.Feature Files               The integration of Gherkin into Ginger using the Gherkin TextEditor allows users to easily read, write and review                 Gherkin Feature files in Ginger. .Feature TextEditor – Layout                      The Gherkin TextEditor is fully integrating with Ginger.        TextEditor LayoutYou can see how the Gherkin TextEditor fits into Ginger and how it played out in the following Fig 6.1.1.This is the Current Feature file that you are working on.This is the Feature name on the first line, and the description in the following lines BEFORE the “spaceline”This is the Scenario with the following Keywords that make up the Scenarios StepsThese are Steps that are within the ScenarioThese are Tags that you can associate functionality within the FeatureThese are the existing automation steps that are already in Ginger Shared Repository having at least one tag associated with the feature or Scenario.Fig 6.1.1          .Feature TextEditor – Autocomplete Lines with existing automationIf an activity (Line) has already been developed it will show in the Line helper shown in Fig 6.2.1 While typing the helper box will give you a list of automated steps to choose from.

What is Cucumber                         Cucumber is a software tool used by computer programmers for testing other software. It runs automated                          acceptance tests written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style. Central to the Cucumber BDD                         approach is its plain language parser called Gherkin.

Cucumber\n      What Ginger has that Cucumber doesn’t\n    \n     \n    \n      ‎\n    What is BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)\n    BDD is a set of best practices for writing great tests. One of the key things BDD addresses is an implementation detail in tests. Behavior-Driven Development addresses this problem by showing you how to test, focusing on testing behavior, and not implementation\n     \n    What is Gherkin Language\n    Gherkin is a line-oriented language that uses indentation to define structure. Line endings terminate statements\n    (called steps) and either spaces or tabs may be used for indentation. (We suggest you use TABS for portability.)\n    Finally, most lines in Gherkin start with a special keyword: (more details in the section: 5)\n    Key Words include (Feature, Scenario, Given, And, Then, When, But)\n    \n     \n    Seamless integration from BDD Gherkin to Ginger Automation\n                         The Ginger Automation tool now can allow users to write scenarios and Ginger will seamlessly turn these scenarios into Automation Activities.\n    \n     \n    Gherkin – Introduction\n     LAYOUT – Gherkin in Ginger\n     In the Solutions Tab, under documents, selecting a <file>.feature will allow you to write scenarios using Gherkin language in Ginger. \n                         \n     \n     \n        LAYOUT – Gherkin “Compile” to Automation\n                         Once you have your scenarios wrote out, you can click the “Compile & Optimize” button and Ginger will convert your scenarios into Ginger as                          \n            Scenarios.\n    \n                       The Compile tab is used to do the following:\n    Clicking “Compile & Optimize” will refresh the Gherkin. feature file into Ginger. Anytime any changes are done in the .feature file, you will need to click the button to allow the changes to be reflected into Ginger.\n    \n    If you select a converted Scenario or Step row, it will highlight in both the .feature file and in the Scenario or Step row. This will allow quick navigation to and from converted scenarios/steps to the actual Gherkin code line.\n    \n    All tags will be shown where you utilized them. Tags will help organize your scenarios for what area these scenarios are for.\n    \n     \n     \n         LAYOUT – Gherkin “Optimize” to Automation\n       Once you have “Compile & Optimize” on the “Optimized” tab, you can see how many times you have reused the same steps. \n    \n                       The Optimize tab is used to do the following:\n    Clicking “Update Business Flow” will refresh the Gherkin. feature file into Ginger Business Flow. Anytime any changes are done in the .feature file, you will need to click the button to allow the changes to be reflected into Ginger.\n    \n    Users will be allowed to see how Optimized they wrote their scenarios. They can view how many times they reused the same steps. This also allows automation developers to know where to start on their automation. Starting to develop those steps that are utilized the most.\n    \n              Users will also be able to check the automation status of each step.\n    \n     \n    IMPORT – Gherkin File to BF\n                             The Ginger Automation Tool can import any Gherkin <file>.feature into Ginger and convert them to a Automation Business Flow in Ginger.\n    \n      ‎\n              IMPORT – Gherkin .feature file to BF\n                        In the Solutions Tab, under Business Flows \n    Right-click on Business Flow or on the Folder you want to create the BF in, and in the dropdown select “Import” à “Import Gherkin Feature”. \n    \n    The File selection window will show, select “…” to browse windows location for your .feature file and click “Open”. \n    \n    You will be able to review the Gherkin file in the preview before selecting “Import” and then select “Generate Business Flow”\n    \n     \n     \n    \n     \n     \n    \n     \n    \n     \n     \n     \n        IMPORT – Gherkin Business Flow creation from.Feature file\n                After importing the Gherkin .feature:\n     Generate Business Flow instructions from Gherkin File\n    You will be given a chance to REVIEW the compiled Scenarios and Steps you just imported. \n    \n    If you are want to proceed to create a Business Flow you can click “Generate Business Flow” .\n    \n    If you see “Update Business Flow” then the Business Flow already exists, and you can update the existing flow.\n    This will create a business flow INSIDE the folder that you originally right-clicked and selected import.\n    \n     \n    \n     \n    IMPORT – Gherkin Optimized Activities to Automation Scenarios in Ginger\n                   If you are creating your scenarios using Gingers Gherkin TextEditor;\n                    After you have completed your new .feature:\n     Optimized Activities\n    You learned how to compile and view the optimized activities.\n    If your Business Flow does not exist you will see in the optimize tab “Generate Business Flow”. \n    This will create your Gherkin Business Flow.\n     \n     \n    OPTIMIZED ACTIVITIES – Gherkin BFs Overview\n                  The Ginger Automation Tool can now support Gherkin BDD Business Flow, utilizing the optimization of our Automation and integrating optimized                             activities.‎\n      ‎\n    Optimized Activities – Gherkin Business Flow Structure\n                 In the Solutions Tab with Gherkin Business flow selected, or having your Business Flow in the Automate Tab you can see the BDD Gherkin Optimized                      \n     Activities.\n     Gherkin Business Flow Structure\n    The Activities Group “Optimized Activities” is the inactive Activities (scenarios) that utilize the “Optimized Activities” activity group to create your scenarios. \n    \n    The unchecked “Active” column in activities is intentional, they are used to create scenarios from the optimized activities. You will also notice that each of the inactive activities will belong to the Activity Group “Optimized Activities” \n    \n    The associated. Feature File is located in the External ID and will give the physical location of the file. \n     \n    \n     \n          Optimized Activities – Gherkin Creating Scenarios from Optimized Activities\n                       In the Solutions Tab with Gherkin Business flow selected, or having your Business Flow in the Automate Tab you can see the BDD Gherkin Optimized                  \n                       Activities.\n     Gherkin Business Flow Create Scenarios from your Optimized Activities\n    When you click “Generate Scenarios”. You will see how many scenarios you have generated, you will see the new Activity groups created from the Optimized Activities, you will see the “Active” Generated Activities for your scenarios below your Optimized activities. \n     \n     \n              Optimized Activities – Gherkin Optimized Activities\n     In the Solutions Tab with Gherkin Business flow selected, or having your Business Flow in the Automate Tab you can see the BDD Gherkin Optimized \n     Activities, After you have generated your scenarios.\n     Optimized Activity Groups\n    You can see details of the Generated Activity Groups by clicking the manager and seeing the grouped activities. You will find your “Optimized Activities” Activity group in the Shared Repository.\n          \n     \n           \n     \n     \n    GHERKIN – Language in Depth\n    The Gherkin language is used by many Business and Functional Testers, writing Tests and Automation with the Gherkin Language is easy to read and write the language.\n    \n      ‎\n    GHERKIN – Language Details\n                             If you do not know what Gherkin is, below is a summary.\n    Gherkin is the language that Cucumber understands. It is a Business Readable, Domain Specific Language that lets you describe software's behavior without detailing how that behavior is implemented. Gherkin serves two purposes — documentation and automated tests.\n                               You can view the in-depth details of the language in the following sections.\n     \n    GHERKIN – Language Syntax\n                              Like Python and YAML, Gherkin is a line-oriented language that uses indentation to define structure. Line endings terminate statements (eg,                        \n                 steps). Either spaces or tabs may be used for indentation (but spaces are more portable). Most lines start with a keyword.\n                              Comment lines are allowed anywhere in the file. They begin with zero or more spaces, followed by a hash sign (#) and some amount of text.\n                              The parser divides the input into features, scenarios, and steps. When you run the feature the trailing portion (after the keyword) of each step is                  \n               matched to a Ruby code block called Step Definitions\n                    A Gherkin source file usually looks like this\n     1: Feature: Some terse yet descriptive text of what is desired\n     2: Textual description of the business value of this feature\n     3: Business rules that govern the scope of the feature\n     4: Any additional information that will make the feature easier to understand\n     5: Scenario: Some determinable business situation\n     6: Given some precondition\n     7: And some other precondition\n     8: When some action by the actor\n     9: And some other action\n     10: And yet another action\n     11: Then some testable outcome is achieved\n     12: And something else we can check happens too\n     13: Scenario: A different situation\n    \n     First-line starts the feature. Lines 2–4 are unparsed text, which is expected to describe the business value of this feature. Line 6 starts a scenario.\n     Lines 7–13 are the steps for the scenario.etc.\n     \n    GHERKIN – Feature Introduction\n    Every .feature file conventionally consists of a single feature. A line starting with the keyword Feature followed by free indented text starts a feature. A feature usually contains a list of scenarios. You can write whatever you want up until the first scenario, which starts with the word Scenario (or localized equivalent; Gherkin is localized for dozens of languages) on a new line. You can use tagging to group features and scenarios together independent of your file and directory structure.\n    \n     Every scenario consists of a list of steps, which must start with one of the keywords Given, When, Then, But or And. Gherkin Editors treats them \n     all the same, but you shouldn’t.\n     \n    GHERKIN – Language Key Words\n                         Below are the Gherkin Key Words, if you want more information please click the associated link in the More Info.\n    KeyWord Table with links for additional info if needed.\n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              keyword\n            \n            \n              localized\n            \n            \n              more info, see\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              name\n            \n            \n              ‘English’\n            \n            \n               \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              native\n            \n            \n              ‘English’\n            \n            \n               \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              encoding\n            \n            \n              ‘UTF-8’\n            \n            \n               \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              feature\n            \n            \n              ‘Feature’\n            \n            \n              Feature Introduction\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              background\n            \n            \n              ‘Background’\n            \n            \n              Background\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              scenario\n            \n            \n              ‘Scenario’\n            \n            \n              Feature Introduction\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              scenario_outline\n            \n            \n              ‘Scenario Outline’\n            \n            \n              Scenario outlines\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              examples\n            \n            \n              ‘Examples’ / ‘Scenarios’\n            \n            \n              Scenario outlines\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              given\n            \n            \n              ‘Given’\n            \n            \n              Given-When-Then\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              when\n            \n            \n              ‘When’\n            \n            \n              Given-When-Then\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              then\n            \n            \n              ‘Then’\n            \n            \n              Given-When-Then\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              and\n            \n            \n              ‘And’\n            \n            \n              Given-When-Then\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              but\n            \n            \n              ‘But’\n            \n            \n              Given-When-Then\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n             GHERKIN – Writing Scenarios Best Practices\n                                We suggest using indentation with spaces to organize your scenarios in your feature file.\n     File Organization\n    You can see how we organized our feature files on an application level with folders \n    \n     Step Optimization for Reusability\n    We also suggest using what has already been developed in the repository.

      The user is working on Ginger for long hours and because of some unavoidable condition's Ginger crashes.\n               Hence, we are providing the AutoSave and Recover mechanism to save user's recent work and give them an option to Recover their work.\n    \n       How does AutoSave work?\n    When the user will start working in Ginger, (at the start of an application), the AutoSave mechanism will be triggered.\n    After 5 minutes, every Business Flow and Run Set which you have worked on will be saved in the AutoSave folder. This will be created at the run time in your Solution folder path.\n    Run Set / Business Flow will be created/saved in the AutoSave folder as the same folder structure as the original one.\n    Once any Business Flow / Run Set has been saved, it will be removed from the AutoSave folder.\n    Only items that are unsaved and worked on will be saved in the AutoSave folder.\n    If you are closing Ginger manually then all the contents of the AutoSave folder will be cleared.\n    Right now, we are only storing Business Flow and Run Set files in the AutoSave folder.\n    The support for storing other files like Environment, Agents, etc. will be supported soon. In the coming Releases.\n    \n    Location of AutoSave folder :\n    \n    \n       Files that are being saved by the AutoSave mechanism is as below:\n                \n    \n       How does Recover work?\n    If Ginger has been closed abruptly or has been crashed last time, then all the files from AutoSave folders will be moved to the Recover folder.\n    The recover folder will be created at the Solution folder path.\n    As soon as you will reopen Ginger, if there are any files in the Recover folder then a message will be shown on the UI with all the files listed inside it.\n         \n    \n    You can view details of each file, by clicking on the View Details Button or Double click event of a particular item.\n    \n    \n      Delete Items\n    If the items/ work is not needed, you can delete it by clicking on the Delete Selected button.\n    \n    \n    \n      Recover Items\n    You can also recover the items which need to be recovered by clicking on Recover Selected button.\n    \n    \n    \n    After deleting or recovering the items will be permanently removed from the list and the Recover folder.\n     \n

the Right Value\n      Replace States\n    \n    Save\n     \n     \n     \n    \n      ‎\n     Purpose\n              The purpose is to find and replace fields among the Ginger entities such as Actions, API Models, Variables, etc.\n    \n      Find items\n    Go to the Business Flow tab and double-click on the desired Business Flow. Find and Replace button is displayed as shown below.\n    \n    \n    \n     How to Find Items?\n    Step one will be to select the Item Type user wants to find.\n                 \n    \n    \n    Once selected, Sub Item Type will be visible. In case the selected ‘Item Type’ has a sub-item then by default all ‘Sub Items Type’ will be included \n    in the search. \n    The user has to select the ‘Sub Item’ to narrow the search scope.\n    \n    \n    Populate the ‘Find What’ field with the field value you want to search.\n    If the user wants to include case sensitive in the search, then check the ‘Match Case’ checkbox.\n    If the user wants to find values that are equal to the whole field value check the ‘Match whole word’ check box.\n    \n    \n    Click the find button.\n          \n    \n    \n     Found Items Grid\n                  Grid column dictionary:\n    Item Type – Ginger Entity Type\n    Item Name – Entity Name (Action Name, Activity Name, etc.)\n    Item Path – Relative path from solution directory\n    Item Parent – Parent Path from the Item Path (relative solution directory)\n    Found Field – The actual field name – in case it’s a field inside field it will appear as a path for example IntptValues/EndPointURL/Value (The user will understand the EndPoint URL, it is shown like this because of the way we are saving it on our backend) please try to find the field inside the path in our example ‘EndPointURL’\n    Field Value - The actual field value.\n                   \n    \n      Double Click on the row or click on the View Details to open the Item edit page from where the user can also change the value and save.\n    \n     Replace\n    Only after the finding process is finished, we can run replace process.\n    To see replace configuration please check the Replace Radio Button.\n             \n    \n    \n            Replace Items\n    Once selecting the Replace Radio button, Replace configuration will appear. Replace text box, Replace Selected Button will get displayed.\n    Note: – Value can be replaced only if it is selected, and its status is Pending Replace or Replace Failed.\n                     \n    \n         Also, after selecting the Replace Radio Button 2 new column will be added to the grid Selected and Status.\n        \n    \n    \n    Replace With the Right Value\n    In some cases, Replace will be possible only with the right value:\n    A value which been selected from a list of already defined values cannot be replaced with just any text.\n    Boolean Value – true or false which reflects the checkbox ‘Is checked’ property.\n    To overcome this obstacle, we forced the Replace text box to be changed to a dropdown list with defined values whenever you will select a \n    row from the Find Result grid which meets the above cases.\n    \n    Please note –If you need to replace value like described above make sure to select only rows with the same field so you do not replace all the \n    find value but only the one which selected from this list, the Selected check box will be by default unselected.\n                \n    \n    \n    Replace States\n    To understand the Replace states please refer to the below table\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n        \n

   \n     \n     \n                      Objective\n           This exercise will help you automate a small flow using GINGER.\n           Here we will see the steps on how we automate the flow of launching URL http://abeat.amdocs.com and logging in with some credentials.\n           Also, we will understand customizing the execution report as per our requirement.\n    \n                To create a solution click on the drop-down as shown below and select the ‘Create New Solution’ option.\n     \n    \n     \n     \n    In the pop window, enter the name of the solution (as shown below) browse to the location of the folder where you wish to save your solution.\n     \n    \n     \n               Since we are automating a website flow select the application as “MywebApp” and platform as “WEB”. With a click on create, a solution is                created successfully.\n     \n                     This will load the solution as shown below.\n                \n     \n     \n                      Go to the Configurations tab and click on Agents.\n    In the left panel, the agent is automatically created for the “MyWebApp”.\n    The default driver for the WebApp application is Internet Explorer “SeleniumIE” and the driver type can be changed if needed using the dropdown.\n     \n               \n     \n                     Once the solution and agent are created, double click on the Business flow and it will take you to the automation area.\n    In this window, you will see various sections like Activities Group, Activity-Variables and Actions.\n    \n    By default, Activity1 is added as shown below.\n                 \n     \n     \n                    Go back to the Business Flow by clicking the back arrow at the left top corner.\n    Click on the Variables tab, Business Flow variables are added here.\n    Click on the + sign to create a new variable that can be used in all the Activities within the Business Flow.\n               \n     \n             Here we will use the variable to give the name of the website which we intend to open as part of our automation flow.\n             Select the variable type from the list shown like in our case the website name will be a variable string as highlighted in the list below.

To open an existing solution, click Test and select Open Existing Solution. \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n     Business Flows tab\n    This tab displays all business flows of a solution. It also displays the automation items available in a business flow, such as the activities, activities groups, variables, configurations, and actions.\n    \n    \n      A business flow is a group of activities that define at least one end-to-end function flow or test scenario. The screenshot below shows how a new BAN is created in a telecom application. It shows the name, description, target application, and other details of the business flow.\n      When you double-click Flow 1, the tab will display the Automation area, with the actions, variables, activities groups, and activities created.\n      To go to the Automation area, click the Automate button in the panel on the right:\n    \n    \n    \n    The following are parts of the automation area:\n    \n      An Activity is a set of actions that address a particular functional requirement as part of a business flow. A business flow can contain multiple activities. \n      The Actions tab presents actions, which are the steps taken by the user or system.\n      The Variables tab is the area where new variables can be added.\n      The Configurations tab shows the configuration of the selected activity.\n      The + button opens the area from where actions can be added and other things like Spy, shared repository, and API models can be used.\n    \n    \n     \n     Run tab\n    The is the area where run sets are created for execution. For more details, refer to Library -> Solution -> Run Sets of Ginger Help Index.\n    \n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     Configurations tab\n    All configuration-related items are created in this tab.\n    \n    \n    \n      Target Applications presents the applications (Web, Unix, Java, and so on) on which the executable actions will be run.\n      Agents are the drivers used for recording a test and for running the target application under test.\n      Internal Browser is used for recording a web application. It is an in-built and customized form of Internet Explorer. Selenium IE, Firefox, and Chrome drivers allow running scripts in these respective browsers, and they are launched as separate browsers.\n      Reports is where the test results are displayed.\n      Use Tags to create tags that identify a set of automation items.\n    \n    \n     \n     Resources tab\n    All resource-related items can be created in this tab.\n    \n    \n    \n      Shared Repository stores all automation items of a shared repository in the solution. These items can be used in other business flows present in the same solution.\n      Application Models contains Auto Pilot, which is a testing automation functionality that is based on machine learning. Auto Pilot functionalities enable automatic modeling and learning of application capabilities in four model areas: front-end (UI), middle layer (APIs), back-end processes, and database.\n      Use Environments to store global details that will be used across multiple businesses flows present in a solution. Also use Environments to store database connection details, login credentials, Unix server details, and any general parameters that will be used globally.\n      Use Global Variables to create all variables that will be used in the business flows present in the solution.\n      Data Sources is the database internally used by Ginger. Either MS Access or a Ginger data source can be used.\n      Documents are a folder in the Ginger Solution folder and are used to store all documents related to the solution. Use it to store scripts, templates, and output files. \n      Plugins are third-party add-ons for capabilities that extend Ginger. \n    \n    \n    \n

   \n    \n    \n    Contents \n    Configuring Solution\n    Configuration for Windows\n    Automation Procedure\n    \n      Understanding the Ginger Window Explorer\n      Ginger Windows Actions\n      Automating Desktop\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     Windows Automation enables Ginger to Automate windows .NET-based apps, including the elements on Desktop.\n     \n     Configuring Solution\n    \n      Click on the Solution name drop-down and select the ‘Create New Solution’ option.\n     \n    \n    \n    \n      Click on Create New Solution, enter Solution Name, browse Solution Folder, Select Main Application Name as “MyWindowsApp”, Select Main \n    Application Platform “Windows” andthen click Create.\n     \n    \n    \n    Configuration for Windows\n      At least one agent is required for Windows Automation. When a new solution is created, a default agent is available in the solution. Another \n    Agent can be added with the below  steps.\n    \n    \n     Configuring Agent \n     To add a new Agent, go to the Configurations --> Agents, and click on the + button as shown below.\n     \n    \n    \n     The Agent Wizard is displayed. It shows the information about the Agent. Click on the Next button.\n     \n    \n    \n      It is advisable to go as per the methodology as Windows_<Application_Name>\n     In this case, we do not have any specific application, so we are using the agent name as “Windows Platform Agent”.\n     Select the Platform as ‘Windows’ and click on the Next button.\n     \n    ‎\n     Driver Configurations window gets displayed. Users can edit the parameters if desired.\n     Users can click on the ‘Test Agent’ button to test if the connection is successful.\n     Click on the Finish button.\n     \n     \n      The Agent is added to the list.\n     \n    \n    \n    Configuring Business flow:\n    \n    While adding new Business flow, a user must select the target application “WindowsApplication”, so that Ginger would make the \n    Windows agents available for that business flow.\n     \n     \n     If the business flow is created already, the above dialog box will be displayed in the Details tab of the Activity.\n     \n    \n    \n     Automation Procedure\n    \n      Automation in Windows is possible only through spying (using the Window Explorer of Ginger). \n     Recording actions are not implemented for Windows.\n    \n     After the Agent has connected successfully, a green switch would indicate all is working.\n     \n    \n    \n    \n    Concept and additional information -\n    \n     In simple words, you need to use Switch Window action always before performing any activities on a particular window. \n     This action tells Ginger which window to work on out of many running windows applications.\n    \n    \n     How does it work?\n     When we say we want to Automate a windows application, the first question comes:\n     How will Ginger identify the window that we want to automate out of all the windows running?\n     The answer is simple. We would tell Ginger to Automate a specific window by using its window name as its identity. Thus, we refer to the \n    window to automate \n     by using its window name and switching to that window before performing any other actions on it.\n    \n    \n     Understanding the Ginger Window Explorer\n     To open Ginger’s Window Explorer, click on the + button as shown below.\n     \n    \n      Click on the Explorer button.\n     \n    \n    \n      Then following window get displayed.\n     \n    \n    \n      Adding Switch Window Action -\n     First, select the window which we need to Automate from the Ginger Window Explorer.\n     \n    \n    \n     Note that the selection was done manually in this case.\n     To do this at run time, we need a Switch Window Action with the window name as a parameter.\n     Click on the button shown below to create the activity and add it to the business flow with a single click.\n     \n    ‎\n     As we proceed further with creating the actions for the automation, keep an eye on the “Activity Actions” section, where these actions will be \n    added one by one as soon as we add them.\n    \n     For now, we can see only the action that we have added, i.e., the switch window action:\n     \n    \n      Spying Elements\n     Live Spy tab in the Ginger Window Explorer allows the user to spy on the elements.\n     \n    \n     Click on the Spy button to activate the live spy.\n     \n    \n     When Spy gets activated below Spying... button gets displayed.\n     \n    \n     On the windows application, hover over the area you need to perform an action and press and hold the control button on the keyboard.\n    \n     Suppose if we want to click on the  button in Skype, we hover on that button while keeping the control key pressed. \n     A red border over the element will confirm the element that is being spied.\n     \n    \n     Once the element was identified click on the Stop button as shown below.\n     \n    \n     At this point, the Ginger Window Explorer would look like this:\n     \n    \n     There are 2 sections of the Ginger Window Explorer that we require to check:\n     Actions\n     Locators\n    \n     The Actions section: This section shows the actions that we can perform on that specific element. \n     Users can select Element Type and Element Action depending upon the need.\n     \n    \n     The Locators section: This section will show the different locators that we can use to identify the element. \n     We need to use a locator that works for this scenario. (Ideally should be unique)\n             \n     If any parameters need to be passed in the action (like if you need to set a specific text value in a text box), they should be added in the value \n    textbox of the Ginger Window Explorer. For a button, this is not required, so we will skip that part.\n    \n    \n     Once we have selected the Action and a Locator, we can click on the Run button to test it.\n     (In case it fails, test again with a different locator/action)\n     \n    \n     The test result will be displayed as follows. We can check Execution Status under Execution Details.\n     \n     (If you do not get this message, try using a different locator)\n    \n        As soon as the action is tested to be working, add it to your business flow by using the Add button.\n     \n    \n     Spying different types of Elements\n     There can be multiple element types, like buttons, text box, drop-down, combo box, radio button, etc.\n    \n     For all these different types of elements, the user can select Element Type and Element Actions from the Action tab.\n    \n     Similarly, in case the element is a text box, then the user can perform Set Value, Get Value, Get Control Property, Send Key, Set Text, etc. actions \n    related to the  text box element.\n     \n    \n     Ginger Window Explorer - Conclusion\n     This concludes the Ginger Window Explorer.\n     It is a powerful tool that is flexible to support and handle any type of element and can add actions under it.\n     Not only is it useful in Windows, but you can also use it while Automating Web, CRM or CSM, in the same way.\n    \n    Ginger Windows Actions:\n    \n     Although Ginger Window Explorer selects and adds the action of the required type to the business flow, there can be circumstances where we \n    need to add some actions manually. Hence, let us hover through the actions supported by a Windows Agent.\n     \n    \n     The help topics for these actions are provided in the Ginger interface itself and will be visible by clicking on the action type.\n    \n     Windows Control Action\n     Although the action can be created using Ginger Window Explorer, in some cases we need to use an action that is different from the available \n    list of actions.\n    \n     After the action is added, what the action does can be changed by editing the action.\n     \n    \n     Below is a list of actions used frequently:\n    Click: Performs click operation\n    GetValue: Fetches value from an element\n    IsEnabled: Returns the state of an object as true or false. (Used in checkboxes/radio buttons)\n    SetValue: Sets value in an element. Can be a text box, combo box, list, etc. anything that requires setting a value.\n    DoubleClick: Performs double click operation.\n    RightClick: Performs right-click operation.\n    SendKeys: Sends keyboard strokes to an element. Use this if SetValue is not working.\n    \n    \n     Window Action\n     The action comes with 5 operations that can be performed on a window level. Each action is self-explanatory.\n    \n     \n    \n    \n     Switch Window Action\n     Brings a window in focus to perform actions on it.\n    \n     “Locate By” used is generally “By Title” and “Locate Value” is the title of the window to be brought in focus.\n     \n    \n    \n    Automating Desktop:\n     Items on the desktop can also be Automated using Ginger.\n    \n     To automate an item on a desktop, use “Program Manager” as the Window in the Ginger Window Explorer.\n     \n    \n     After this, the procedure is the same as automating any other application.\n  \n\n","Path::contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Functionalities_and_Tools/Windows_Automation_Run_Book_1.htm::size":43300,"Path::contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Getting_Started/What_is_Ginger.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../css/GingerDocStyle.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Getting_Started/What_is_Ginger.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/GingerDocStyle.css"},{"origLink":"../../css/What is Ginger.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Getting_Started/What_is_Ginger.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/What is Ginger.css"}],"Path::contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Getting_Started/What_is_Ginger.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Getting_Started/What_is_Ginger.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Getting_Started/What_is_Ginger.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Getting_Started/What_is_Ginger.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Getting_Started/What_is_Ginger.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Getting_Started/What_is_Ginger.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Getting_Started/What_is_Ginger.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Getting_Started/What_is_Ginger.htm::Title":"What is Ginger?","Path::contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Getting_Started/What_is_Ginger.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n     \n     What is Ginger?\n    \n    \n    \n     GINGER is a leading open-source automation framework that maximizes the benefits of DevOps, agile development methodology, and \n     cloud migration.

What Is UFT Mobile\n    Micro Focus UFT Mobile provides an end-to-end quality lab of real devices and emulators that help you test, monitor, and optimize your mobile apps for an enhanced user experience. \n    \n     \n    Components of UFT Mobile Environment\n     \n    The UFT Mobile environment consists of the following components\n     \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Component\n            \n            \n              Function\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              UFT Mobile Server\n            \n            \n              This is a single web server that: \n              \n                \n                  Mediates between the testing-tool client calls to mobile devices, and provides a user interface within the testing tool for recording and running tests on real mobile devices. \n                \n                \n                  Accepts apps for testing, and manages app versions. \n                \n                \n                  Includes a PostgreSQL database storing reusable data, such as Metadata of uploaded apps and connectors, certificates, user information, and so forth. \n                \n                \n                  Provides a user interface (Lab Management console) for administrators to: \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  manage users \n                \n                \n                  manage apps and view their properties such as OS and version \n                \n                \n                  control devices: restart, unlock, or open a device remotely \n                \n                \n                  view and manage connectors \n                \n                \n                  configure a variety of settings for users such as proxy definitions and packaging services \n                \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              External PostgreSQL database\n            \n            \n              You can connect UFT Mobile to an existing external PostgreSQL database. This allows your organization to manage and utilize existing DB resources. \n              You specify this option during installation. For details, see UFT Mobile - Windows Installation (on-premises) or UFT Mobile- Linux Installation (on-premises). \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Connector\n            \n            \n              The connector is a lightweight piece of software for connecting devices to UFT Mobile, which can be installed together with the server (embedded connector), or as a standalone component. You can install the connector on multiple machines in distributed locations, or on your testing-tool machine. For more details, see Install the connector on a Windows machine, Install the connector on a Linux machine, or Install the connector on a Mac Machine. \n              The connector manages the physical USB connection to the device, and the logical state machine on top of it. It maps the ports to connect to the device over USB and manages the remote screen viewer stream from the device to the tool. It receives lifecycle events from the USB library such as device connected or device disconnected, Agent finished installing, and Agent started. It transfers these events to the UFT Mobile server for adding the device to the pool. The connector is also responsible for installing and uninstalling apps on the device. \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Test devices accessed via connectors\n            \n            \n              These are the devices (smartphones/tablets) on which the tests are run. The following applications are copied to the test devices: \n              The UFTM Agent, which manages commands to the AUT, to the OS (control outside a specific app), and to the remote screen viewer server that supplies the UI and remote control for the testing-tool clients. \n              The AUT – Application under Test. \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              SV Lab\n            \n            SV (Service Virtualization) Lab is an environment virtualization toolkit for virtualizing real services in areas that would be otherwise difficult to test. The SV Lab is deployed inside UFT Mobile, ready to run Service Virtualization simulations. \n          \n          \n            \n              NV Test Manager\n            \n            Network Virtualization is an optional component for testing apps running under different network conditions. Network virtualization emulates real-world conditions by imposing impairments and constraints in your testing environment during the software testing process, thereby improving software testing accuracy. \n          \n        \n      \n    \n     \n    2. UFT Mobile Server Prerequisites & Installation ‎\n    There are some prerequisites for the UFT Server installation and they vary to the diffrent Operation Systems. \n    In The link you can see the prerequisites for each OS: Link. \n     \n    3. UFT Mobile Connector Prerequisites & Installation\n    The connector is a lightweight piece of software for connecting devices to UFT Mobile, which can be installed together with the server (embedded connector), or as a standalone component. You can install the connector on multiple machines in distributed locations, or on your testing-tool machine. \n    Here you can find the prerequisites and how to install UFT Connector: Link. \n    Here you can download the necessary files for UFT Connector and UFT Mobile Server: Link. \n     \n    4.

Ginger Agent Creation for UFT Mobile           \n    How to Configure Native\\Web Connection\n    \n       First, in Ginger go to Configuration -> Agent and click on the button:\n    \n                     \n    \n     \n    \n      Choose the Mobile Platform as follows:\n    \n                    \n    \n     \n    \n      \n        The Appium Server configuration should be the UFT Mobile URL (including the port number): \n         \n        We will take that URL and put it here:  \n         \n         \n        Then, choose the platform (Android\\iOS) and application type (Native\\Hybrid or Web). \n      \n    \n    How to Select the App\n    \n      \n        For having basic app (Settings app) no need to change anything. \n        To select an App from the UFT App management you will need to specify the appPackage and the appActivity capabilities. \n        In UFT Mobile you can see this here: \n      \n    \n                     \n    \n    How to Select the Device\n    There are 2 ways to select the device: \n    \n      \n        Specify exact udid: each device has a unique udid. If you want a specific device go to the device lab and see the udid of the devices: \n      \n    \n     \n    \n     \n    \n      Take the desired udid and put it in the agent configuration:\n    \n     \n    \n     \n     2. Wildcard: You can use a wildcard (*) to specify the OS required. You can specify a enumeration \n    symbol, such as <, >, <=. >=, and =. \n     \n    For example, \"platformVersion\", \">5.0.1\". \n     \n    Connection Options \n     \n     There are 2 options of connection to a UFT Mobile device: \n    \n      \n        Connecting with an “Access Key” with the following steps: \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        In order to create the access key, you will need to go to Administration: \n      \n    \n     \n    \n      \n        Press on “ACCESS KEYS” and then on the “+” button: \n      \n    \n     \n    \n      \n        Fill in the “Name’ of your access key, Type (for connecting to a UFT device select “execution”), Description (optional), Expiration Date and press “Generate”: \n      \n    \n     \n     \n    \n      \n        You will need the following information: \n      \n    \n     \n     \n    \n      \n        Fill in the capabilities table at the Agent page as follows: \n      \n    \n     \n    \n      \n        Anonymous Connection: \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        In order to enable anonymous connection, you will need to go to Administration: \n      \n    \n     \n    \n      \n        Press “SETTINGS” and search on the left pane for the “Appium Options”: \n      \n    \n     \n    \n      \n        Change the “Anonymous access” to “Yes”: \n      \n    \n     \n    \n      \n        Fill in the capabilities table on the Agents page as follows: \n      \n    \n    As you see, you can drop off the ” uftm:oauthClientId” and ” uftm:oauthClientSecret” capabilities because you can now connect without authenticating. \n     \n    Link to UFT Mobile Appium Capabilities here. \n    For the full capabilities explanation, see “Mobile Appium Agent” guide. \n    UFT Mobile Troubleshooting\n    \n

At the grid’s toolbox will be presented next buttons/controls:\n      \n        Create/Edit a Profile\n        Delete a Profile\n        Search Profile by Name/Description\n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    The grid will show the list of profiles and contain below columns\n      \n        Name\n        Description\n        ALM Type\n        Is Default – a column that will be single-selectable per all values in the rows\n      \n    \n    Once Profile created/selected – Profile’s Fields grid became enabled and populated by fields and their values. Those fields/values will be retrieved from the ALM by the new REST API.Profile’s Fields grid will have below columns:\n      \n        Filed Name\n        Mandatory – can be sorted by clicking on it\n        Selected Values – dropdown with current field’s values list. The value that presented will be the selected one for this profile\n      \n    \n    Deselecting (selecting other) of a Profile will be not available till all mandatory field values will not be selected (value deferent than “N/A”).\n    ‎Closing of a current window also will be not available till all mandatory field values will not be selected. A warning message will be popped in case that is not expected.\n    Closing of a current window will be not available till at least one Profile will be created/exist. A warning message will be popped in case that is not expected.\n  \n  \n  How to automate the opening of Defects?\n  \n    In the Run tab, click on “RunSet” and open the desired run set. Operations and click the button to add the operation “Automated ALM Defect’s Opening”.\n    This operation can be added only when at least one “Defect’s Profiles” exists. A warning message will be popped in case that is no “Defect’s Profiles” are existing yet.\n    To use the operation’s functionality, the operation should be added to the “RunSet Operations” list (as usual operation’s behavior).\n  \n                   \n  \n  \n    New Operation will have next options which the user can select from:\n    Run at\n      \n        “Execution End” – defects will be opened after execution’s end\n        “During Execution” – defects will be during execution – in real-time\n      \n    \n    Condition “Always Run”\n    Defect’s Opening Mode – radio buttons list\n      \n        “Open Defects For All Failures” – selecting this option will cause a creation of defects in ALM for all failures that happened during the execution\n        “Open Defects For Failures that marked at Action’s Flow Control” – selecting this option will creations of defects in ALM for failures that have the predefined condition at Action’s Flow Control\n      \n    \n  \n                        \n  \n    For the above purpose for Action’s flow control will be added new action, called “Set Failure to be Auto-Opened Defect”. \n    If this action will be with the condition “Action Failed” and action will fail – this will cause a defect opening by the current operation\n  \n  \n  \n  How to view opened automated defects?\n  \n    Go to the Runset tab and click on the “ALM Defect’s Opening” tab.\n    This tab presents all the failures that happened during the execution - with all relevant data and screenshots.\n    Till the execution’s end, this tab is disabled. Once execution finished the tab became enabled.\n  \n                 \n  \n  \n    In case of operation “Automated ALM Defect’s Opening” was in use during the last execution (or it’s not the first iteration of defect’s “manual” opening) column “ALM’s defect ID” will be populated per concerted issue. ALM Defect ID will be saved per action at the “RunSet” object\n    \n    In the above grid at the right corner, click on the “Open Selected as Defects at ALM” button.\n    This button is enabled only if at least one issue in a grid has no defect for itself.\n    Once clicked – this will open for selected issues defects in ALM.\n    If ALM connectivity is not working correctly – a warning message will be popped and action will be aborted. Otherwise, defects will be opened in ALM with values per field as at currently selected “Defect’s Profile”.\n    The defect will be opened in a below-described way (the same way is relevant for the opening of defects with operation “Automated ALM Defect’s Opening”):\n      \n        Naming convention: <<BusinessFlow>>_<<Activity>>_<<Action>>_”Failed”\n        Defect description - should copy the steps of the test that was run. Example:\n        BusinessFlow Name (failed)\n        Activity Group Name\n        Activity Group Name (failed)\n        Activity\n        Activity (failed)\n        Action\n        Action (failed)\n        Variables of failed entities (of all levels) also will be added to the description\n        Defect’s Attachment - screenshot will be attached to the defect, showing the error.\n      \n    \n  \n  Automate ALM TC & Add it to Ginger Repository\n  Once the user has imported ALM Test (to a Business Flow) or exported Ginger Business Flow to ALM he can automate the Ginger Activities Group andadds them to the Ginger Solution repository so they will be reused the next time those ALM TC’s will be used in other Tests that will be imported to Ginger\n  For automating an ALM TC & add it to the Ginger repository please follow below steps:\n  \n    Import ALM Test Set into Ginger\n    Double click on it to go to the “Automate” tab\n    Record or manually add the automation Actions for the relevant ALM TC Steps matching Ginger Steps\n    Test and make sure the Ginger Steps have been executed as expected.\n    Mark the “Automation Status” of the automated Ginger Steps to “Automated” in all the Activities of the Business Flow.\n  \n             \n  \n  \n    This makes the Business Flow fully automated\n  \n               \n   \n  Add the Activity Group (Test Case in ALM) to the Solution Shared Repository by:\n  \n    Go to the Automate tab by double-clicking on the Business Flow\n  \n  \n    Click on the “…” near the Activity Group\n    Select the “Add Activities Group to Shared Repository” option\n    All the details in it get added to the Solution Shared Repository\n    Note: In case the Ginger Test Case or one of its Ginger Steps already exists in the Repository the user will be asked if he wants to overwrite the existing one.\n  \n                 \n  \n                                    8.   The Shared repository wizard is displayed. Click on the Next button, verify the details and then click on the Finish button.\n                           \n  \n                                            9.  You can view it under the Resources-> Shared Repository tab.\n                            \n  \n                        Note: For reflecting the automated TC’s in the Design Console (ATS) application the user will need to Check-In the automated items                       (Ginger Test Cases & Ginger Steps) to the Source Control (SVN).\n\n","Path::contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/ALM_Integrations/Ginger_Octane_ALM_Integration.htm::size":41112,"Path::contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../css/GingerDocStyle.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/GingerDocStyle.css"},{"origLink":"https://github.com/Visual-Regression-Tracker/Visual-Regression-Tracker#readme","attr":"href","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"a","external":true,"relPath":"https://github.com/Visual-Regression-Tracker/Visual-Regression-Tracker#readme"},{"origLink":"../../images/image452.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image452.png"},{"origLink":"../../images/image453.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image453.png"},{"origLink":"../../images/image454.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image454.png"},{"origLink":"../../images/image455.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image455.png"},{"origLink":"../../images/image456.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image456.png"},{"origLink":"../../images/image457.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image457.png"},{"origLink":"../../images/image458.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image458.png"},{"origLink":"../../images/image459.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image459.png"},{"origLink":"../../images/image460.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image460.png"},{"origLink":"../../images/image461.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image461.png"},{"origLink":"../../images/image462.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image462.png"},{"origLink":"../../images/image466.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image466.png"},{"origLink":"../../images/image463.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image463.png"},{"origLink":"../../images/image464.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image464.png"},{"origLink":"../../images/image465.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image465.png"},{"origLink":"../../images/image467.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image467.png"},{"origLink":"../../images/image468.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/image468.png"},{"origLink":"https://ginger-automation.github.io/Ginger-Web-Help/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Run_Sets/How_to_Execute_Run_set_Via_CLI.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/assets/Ginger_By_Amdocs/Integrations/Visual_Testing_using_VRT.htm","nodeName":"a","external":true,"r

 Visual Testing using VRT\n  Ginger has the capability for visual testing. Visual testing is used when we would like to analyze entire application pages and report differences only visible to the human eye. Break down images into their layout and structure and automatically detect similar differences across different pages of your app running on different browsers and devices.\n  Ginger is integrated with Visual Regression Tracker (VRT) which is open source tool for automated visual UI testing and monitoring, a full manual regression of the UI, covering multiple operating systems, web browsers, screen resolutions, and localizations etc.\n  Pre-requisites \n  \n    Linux Box with VRT Installation on it, steps to install VRT are availlable here\n    VRT API details like URL, key, etc. get these details from user profile on VRT dashboard.\n    Ginger version (4.4.1 and above)\n  \n   \n  Visual Testing Confiugurations\n  To enable visual testing, we need to set VRT configuration details in the Ginger application as below:\n  \n    Click on the ‘Configurations’ tab.\n    Click on ‘External Integrations’ tab.\n    Click on ‘VRT Configuration’.\n  \n  \n   \n  Visual testing in Action\n  Adding Visual testing Action\n  For automating visual testing, users can add Visual Testing action from Action library.\n  \n  \n  Select Visual Regression Tracker as Visual testing Analyzer\n  \n  Operations supported by VRT\n  Start Test\n  This action needs to be added to notify VRT tool the start of the visual testing session.\n  \n    VRT Action: Select VRT Action as Start Test\n  \n                \n  \n    Difference tolerance %  can be set to the % upto which the difference can be ignored when comparing the screenshots. By default the value is set to 0%.\n    Test name works as Build name for all actions/activity/flow\n  \n   \n  Checkpoint\n  In VRT Action we can select checkpoint with two different types as below\n  One or more Checkpoint actions can be added to existing Automation flow to compare the baseline with current UI.\n  When running the checkpoint action for the first time, Ginger will capture screenshot and sent it to VRT as baseline image. User will need to approve the baseline from VRT. This is explained in later section of the document.\n  \n    Action by Window- will compare the entire window or page\n  \n                    \n  \n    Action by Region will compare the specific element or frame or region of the page.  Locator for the specific element needs to be configured for this option\n  \n               \n  Stop Test\n  After all visual testing check points, Stop Test action needs to be configured to notify VRT the end of Visual testing session\n  \n   \n  VRT Dashboard\n  Configuring Baseline\n  For Accepting or defining the baseline, the user needs to login to VRT dashboard.\n  If the action fails with error ‘No Baseline’, On VRT Dashboard you can set the base line image.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n   \n   \n  Ignore specific regions\n  You can ignore some part from the comparison in VRT e.g., Advertisements, Date etc.\n  Open the specific baseline image from VRT, and click on ignore areas.\n  Then draw the rectangle to ignore the specific part of the image.\n   \n  \n  \n   \n  Test name here should be as Build name\n              \n   \n  Validating Differences or failures\n  If any action fails with the errors ‘Difference found’, you can see the difference image in the action result as well as on the VRT Dashboard as shown below\n   \n  \n   \n   \n  \n   \n  Run in Visual Testing Mode\n  On Automate tab or on the Runner level configuration we have a flag as “Run In Visual Testing Mode”, which can be is used determine whether to execute the Visual Testing actions or skip.\n  Default this configuration is set to true, it means when we have Visual Testing Actions in the flow will be executed, otherwise all the visual testing action will be skipped.\n  To configure the ‘Run In Visual Testing Mode’ on Automate tab follow below steps.\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                Click on settings icon (Runner Configurations)\n                Check or uncheck ‘Run In Visual Testing Mode’\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  To configure the ’Run In Visual Testing Mode’ on Runset tab follow below steps.\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                Click on settings icon of Runner (Runner Configurations)\n                Check or uncheck ‘Run In Visual Testing Mode’\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  You can also use the same flag, from CLI as well, for dynamic execution configuration.

 Ginger QC ALM Integration\n  Ginger comes with seamless integration with Microfocus ALM Octane, and this document comes to explain how to use the integration functionalities.\n  Current supported functionalities are:\n  \n    Import Octane Test Suite into Ginger and automatically converting it to Ginger Business flow which will be ready to be automated or even execute in case it’s TC’s were already automated before by Ginger\n    Export Ginger Business Flow to Octane - each one of the Business Flow Activities Group will be export to Octane Application Module as Manual Test Case item and a Test Suite item will be created in ALM Application Module containing all the relevant Octane Test Cases which were exported\n    Export imported Ginger Business flow execution details back to Octane and reflect the execution status in the matching Octane Test Suit Run status\n  \n  Connect Ginger to QC\n  To set ALM connecting details in a Ginger application please follow below steps\n  \n

Those fields/values will be retrieved from the ALM by the new REST API.Profile’s Fields grid will have below columns:\n      \n        Filed Name\n        Mandatory – can be sorted by clicking on it\n        Selected Values – dropdown with current field’s values list. The value that presented will be the selected one for this profile\n      \n    \n    Deselecting (selecting other) of a Profile will be not available till all mandatory field values will not be selected (value deferent than “N/A”).\n    ‎Closing of a current window also will be not available till all mandatory field values will not be selected. A warning message will be popped in case that is not expected.\n    Closing of a current window will be not available till at least one Profile will be created/exist. A warning message will be popped in case that is not expected.\n  \n  \n  How to automate the opening of Defects?\n  \n    In the Run tab, click on “RunSet” and open the desired run set. Operations and click the button to add the operation “Automated ALM Defect’s Opening”.\n    This operation can be added only when at least one “Defect’s Profiles” exists. A warning message will be popped in case that is no “Defect’s Profiles” are existing yet.\n    To use the operation’s functionality, the operation should be added to the “RunSet Operations” list (as usual operation’s behavior).\n  \n                   \n  \n  \n    New Operation will have next options which the user can select from:\n    Run at\n      \n        “Execution End” – defects will be opened after execution’s end\n        “During Execution” – defects will be during execution – in real-time\n      \n    \n    Condition “Always Run”\n    Defect’s Opening Mode – radio buttons list\n      \n        “Open Defects For All Failures” – selecting this option will cause a creation of defects in ALM for all failures that happened during the execution\n        “Open Defects For Failures that marked at Action’s Flow Control” – selecting this option will creations of defects in ALM for failures that have the predefined condition at Action’s Flow Control\n      \n    \n  \n                        \n  \n    For the above purpose for Action’s flow control will be added new action, called “Set Failure to be Auto-Opened Defect”. \n    If this action will be with the condition “Action Failed” and action will fail – this will cause a defect opening by the current operation\n  \n  \n  \n  How to view opened automated defects?\n  \n    Go to the Runset tab and click on the “ALM Defect’s Opening” tab.\n    This tab presents all the failures that happened during the execution - with all relevant data and screenshots.\n    Till the execution’s end, this tab is disabled. Once execution finished the tab became enabled.\n  \n                 \n  \n  \n    In case of operation “Automated ALM Defect’s Opening” was in use during the last execution (or it’s not the first iteration of defect’s “manual” opening) column “ALM’s defect ID” will be populated per concerted issue. ALM Defect ID will be saved per action at the “RunSet” object\n    \n    In the above grid at the right corner, click on the “Open Selected as Defects at ALM” button.\n    This button is enabled only if at least one issue in a grid has no defect for itself.\n    Once clicked – this will open for selected issues defects in ALM.\n    If ALM connectivity is not working correctly – a warning message will be popped and action will be aborted. Otherwise, defects will be opened in ALM with values per field as at currently selected “Defect’s Profile”.\n    The defect will be opened in a below-described way (the same way is relevant for the opening of defects with operation “Automated ALM Defect’s Opening”):\n      \n        Naming convention: <<BusinessFlow>>_<<Activity>>_<<Action>>_”Failed”\n        Defect description - should copy the steps of the test that was run.

PurposeThe Ruby Plugin target is to allow executing Ruby scripts from Ginger as an integrative part of the Ginger test flow. Ginger Ruby plugin allows to:Configure Ruby script execution by using a script file.Configure Ruby script execution by using script content. For the above execution methods ginger ruby plugin offers:Send execution Input Values to Ruby script.    Get execution output values by parsing and showing console values and look for “key=value” pairs                   The purpose of this document is to provide step by step guide on the Ginger Ruby plugin way of installing and using it.    PrerequisitesPlease see below the items which need to be set up on the testing environment before executing the Ruby plugin..NET Core SDK InstallationThe plugin requires .NET Core SDK version 2.2 or above to be installed on the machine it is running on.Please install it from the below link:https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download Ruby InstallationRuby installation is a must for the plugin to work.Script The Ruby script files need to be located on the machine on which the Ruby Plugin running.It is recommended to place the script under the Ginger Solution “Documents” folder and use relative paths to it (like “~/Documents/Scripts”) so it will work on any user machine.  Install Ruby PluginGinger Ruby plugin needs to be installed to the Ginger Solution to be used.Please follow the below steps to perform it.Add Ruby Plugin to Ginger SolutionDownload and Install the latest/required Ginger version from hereLaunch Ginger and add a Solution to itIn Solution go to Resources PluginsClick on the “Download Plugin” tabSelect “Ruby” Plugin from loaded list of PluginsSelect latest/required Plugin versionClick on Install Once installation is done, shift to the “Installed” tab and confirm the ”Ruby” plugin appears on the tree- you will see the Plugin details on the right including its embedded action types.   3. Executing Ruby Script Please follow the below steps to execute the Ruby script.3.1 Execute Ruby script using an external file.Add Business Flow or select an existing one and click on “Automate” for loading it on Automate pageClick on Add Action button, in the loaded window go to “Plugins Actions”Select “Run Script file” Action       Set Action configurations according to the below: Field NameMandatory?Field DescriptionSample ValueCommentsRuby Script PathYesFull Path of the ruby script file. “C:\\Work\\Ruby\\ RubyScript.py”For allowing the Action to run on any machine It is recommended to place the ruby script file under the Ginger Solution “Documents” folder and set a relative path to it in Action definitions like:“~\\Documents\\Scripts\\BasicScript.py”Delimiter NoSplit the console output param/value= Input ParametersNoAdd ruby input parameters as per requirement.    Execute Ruby script using content. Add Business Flow or select an existing one and click on “Automate” for loading it on Automate pageClick on Add Action button, in the loaded window go to “Plugins Actions”Select “Run Script” Action  Set Action configurations according to the below: Field NameMandatory?Field DescriptionSample ValueCommentsRuby Script ContentYesCopy-Paste Ruby script. if ARGV.length != 2puts \"We need exactly two arguments\"exitendnum1=ARGV[0].to_inum2=ARGV[1].to_isum=num1+num2puts \"Result = #{sum}\" Delimiter NoSplit the console output param/value= Input ParametersNoAdd Ruby input parameters as per requirement.       Get Output Values from Ruby Flow to Ginger Flow Ruby plugin supports getting output values from the Ruby Flow.It has been done by parsing all values which the Ruby flow writes to the Console during execution, the parsing mechanism looks for any “key=value” pair and if it been found so the Key and Value been added to the Action Output Values list. How to Get Output Values from Ruby Flow to Ginger FlowPrepare the Ruby Flow Code for Sharing Output ValuesOpen the Script in notepad or another Editor.Look for the places in code (either tested class methods or actual test methods) which have values that can be shared with Ginger during executionIn each such place, add a “puts” line of code with the Value key name equal to the value that needs to be shared, see sample below:  Configure Ginger Ruby Plugin Action to Read Output ValuesConfigure any one of the Ruby Actions configurationsAfter execution end, go to Action “Output Values” tab and see all output values which were parsed in run timeNow you can set Validations on top of those values or pass them to Variables/Data Source or others to be used in the next Actions/other in the Ginger flow

Get Output Values from Groovy Flow to Ginger Flow The groovy plugin supports getting output values from the Groovy Flow.It has been done by parsing all values which the Groovy flow writes to the Console during execution, the parsing mechanism looks for any “key=value” pair and if it been found so the Key and Value been added to the Action Output Values list. How to Get Output Values from Groovy Flow to Ginger FlowPrepare the Groovy Flow Code for Sharing Output ValuesOpen the Script in notepad or another Editor.Look for the places in code (either tested class methods or actual test methods) which have values that can be shared with Ginger during executionIn each such place, add a “println()” line of code with the Value key name equal to the value that needs to be shared, see sample below:  Configure Ginger Groovy Plugin Action to Read Output ValuesConfigure any one of the Groovy Actions configurationsAfter execution end, go to Action “Output Values” tab and see all output values which were parsed in run timeNow you can set Validations on top of those values or pass them to Variables/Data Source or others to be used in the next

integrative part of the Ginger test flow.\n    \n           Ginger TestNG plugin allows to:\n    Configure Java/Maven TestNG execution by TestNG test configuration XML\n    Configure Java/Maven TestNG execution by free command line\n    \n        For the above execution methods the Ginger TestNG plugin offers:\n    Send execution Input Values by overwriting the TestNG test XML parameters values\n    Get execution output values by parsing execution console values and look for “key=value” pairs\n    Automatic TestNG execution results parsing and showing the below on Ginger Action/Report:\n    Number of Passed/Failed/Skipped/Ignored/Total tests\n    Executed Suite/s details\n    Execution status of each executed Test\n    Error details for Failed/Skipped tests\n    \n         The purpose of this document is to provide step by step guide on the Ginger TestNG plugin way of installing and using it.\n    \n      ‎\n    Prerequisites\n    Please see below the items which need to be set up on the testing environment before executing the TestNG plugin.\n     \n    .NET Core SDK Installation\n    The plugin requires .NET Core SDK version 2.2 or above to be installed on the machine is running on.\n    Please install it from the below link:\n    https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download\n     \n      Java Installation\n    Java installation is a must for the plugin to work.\n    “JAVA_HOME” environment variable system configuration is also required in case not specifying a specific path for the “java” executable in the Plugin Action definitions.\n     \n    Maven Installation\n    Maven installation is a must just in case executing the Maven Java project.\n    “MAVEN_HOME”/”M2_HOME” environment variable system configuration is also required in case not specifying a specific path for the “mvn” executable in the Plugin Action definitions.\n     \n    Java/Maven Project\n    The Java/Maven project source files need to be located on the machine on which the TentNG Plugin running on.\n    It is recommended to place the project under the Ginger Solution “Documents” folder and use relative paths to it (like “~/Documents/MyJavaProject”) so it will work on any user machine.\n    \n      ‎\n    Install TestNG Plugin\n    Ginger TestNG plugin needs to be added to the Ginger Solution to be used.\n    Please follow the below steps to perform it.\n     \n    Add TestNG Plugin to Ginger Solution\n    \n      Download and Install the latest/required Ginger version from here\n      Lunch Ginger and add Solution to it\n      In Solution go to Resources Plugins\n      Click on the “Online” tab\n      Select “Test NG” Plugin from loaded list of Plugins\n      Select latest/required Plugin version\n      Click on Install\n    \n     \n     \n    Once installation is done,

   \n    \n      ‎\n      Sending Input Values to TestNG Flow from Ginger Flow\n     TestNG plugin supports sending input values from Ginger flow to TestNG flow.\n        It has been done by overwriting the values of the TestNG XML Parameters.\n        Input values can be static or dynamic (variables, environment parameters, Etc.) by using the Value Expression capabilities.\n        In case Input values have been configured, the plugin will duplicate the original TestNG XML into a temp file, will overwrite the Parameters values on the          \n     duplicated XML and will use the duplicated XML for actual execution.\n       In case the user prefers to overwrite the original TestNG XML and not to create temp duplication he should check the “Overwrite Original TestNG XML”     \n       check box.\n     \n    How to Send Input Values to TestNG Flow from Ginger Flow\n    Configure any one of the TestNG Actions configurations\n    Set the “TestNG XML Path” field in the Action configurations\n    Open the TestNG XML to view its content and look for the “Parameters” nodes in it which you want to overwrite its values\n    For each parameter which you want to overwrite its value:\n    Add row to the “TestNG Xml Parameters To Overwrite” grid\n    Set the cell of the “Name” column as the name on Parameter in the TestNG XML\n    In case the Parameter appears in more than one node and you want to modify only a specific one and not all so set the name on the Parameter Parent node in the cell of the “ParentNodeName” column\n    Set the value to be used in the “Value” column cell\n    All cell values can be fully/partially dynamic using the Value Expression editor (“…” button).\n    \n    \n      ‎\n       Get Output Values from TestNG Flow to Ginger Flow\n    TestNG plugin supports getting output values from the TestNG Flow.\n    It has been done by parsing all values which the TestNG flow write to the Console during execution, the parsing mechanism looks for any “key=value” pair and if it been found so the Key and Value been added to the Action Output Values list.\n    \n    TestNG plugin also supports getting all the Errors which been written to the Console during TestNG Flow execution and Fail the Ginger Action in case an Error exists. For enabling it you should check the “Fail Action Due To Console Errors”\n       How to Get Output Values from TestNG Flow to Ginger Flow\n    Prepare the TestNG Flow Code for Sharing Output Values\n    Open the Java project in Eclipse or other IDE\n    Look for the places in code (either tested class methods or actual test methods) which in them you have the value that can be shared with Ginger during execution\n    In each such place, add a “System.out.println()” line of code with the Value key name equal to the value that needs to be shared, see sample below:\n    \n     \n    Configure Ginger TestNG Plugin Action to Read Output Values\n    Configure any one of the TestNG Actions configurations\n    For the Action to read and parse the Console outputs, check the “Parse Console Outputs” check box\n    After execution end, go to Action “Output Values” tab and see all output values which were parsed in run time\n    Now you can set Validations on top of those values or pass them to Variables/Data Source or others to be used in the next Actions/other in the Ginger flow\n    \n     \n    \n    \n      ‎\n     \n       Parsing TestNG Flow Execution Results\n    TestNG Plugin supports parsing the TestNG execution results XML (testing-results.xml).\n    The values which been pulled from the TestNG execution results XML are:\n    Number of Passed/Failed/Skipped/Ignored/Total tests\n    Executed Suite/s details\n    Execution status of each executed Test\n    Error details for Failed/Skipped tests\n    \n    Validations can be configured on top of the report values, like setting validation that specific Test status is “Passed”.\n    \n    Ginger Action status can indicate if all TestNG flow Tests Passed or not, in case the “Fail Action Due To TestNG Results Xml Failure” check box is checked, Ginger Action status will be “Passed” only if all TestNG flow tests will Pass and in the case at least 1 TestNG flow test will Fail so also the Ginger Action status will be “Failed” and the failure reason will be shown on the Action Status and also in Ginger execution report.\n     \n    How to Get TestNG Execution Results on Ginger Action\n    Configure any one of the TestNG Actions configurations\n    Check the “Parse TestNG Results Xml” check box\n    In case the TestNG “TestNG-results.xml” is configured not to be generated in the default location of it, please specify the full path to the Folder in which the “testng-results.xml” will be found at the end of Execution in the “Overwrite TestNG Results Xml Default Folder Path”. If the default location is been used so you can leave the text box empty.\n     \n    For Failing the Action in case the TestNG results contain Failures/Errors – please check the “Fail Action Due To TestNG Results Xml Failure” check box\n    \n     \n    \n

repository is a centralized repository within Ginger for sharing Variables/Actions/Activities/Activities Groups across one or more Business flows present in the solution. Sharing ensures the re-usability of the components and reduces the mean time to maintain the Automation. \n    In GINGER the smallest unit of re-usability is an Action. \n    \n     \n    View Shared Repository\n    \n      Shared Repository is visible in the automation area by double-clicking on the desired Business Flow\n      Click on that arrow (+) shown below\n    \n                    \n     \n     \n                         \n     \n     \n    \n      Shared Repository is also available in the Resources tab as shown below\n    \n    \n    Upload Activity to Shared Repository as Linked Instance\n    Uploading Activity as Linked instance is the new and recommended option.

And different business flow where it is used will have only the reference or pointer to the shared repository instance. \n      Any changes made in shared repository activity will be Automatically reflected to all the instance usages\n    \n    \n     \n                 \n     \n    \n      For the Activity pulled as Linked instance, The ‘Link icon’ near the Activity will be displayed in Orange Color\n    \n     \n                  \n     \n    Regular Instance\n    \n      In this the Activity copy or clone is created on the business flows where it used and Shared Activity id is kept as reference.  \n      Any changes made in shared activity needs to be explicitly published to selected instance usages\n    \n     \n                   \n    \n    \n      For the Activity pulled as Regular instance, The ‘Star icon’ near the Activity will be displayed in Orange Color\n    \n     \n                    \n    Edit Items in Shared Reposioty\n    \n      The Items in the shared repository can be modified using the pen icon (Edit) as highlighted below.\n    \n                   \n    \n    \n      This opens the Edit window as shown below.\n    \n                  \n    \n      On clicking the Save button, a message is populated for confirmation of changes if the item is used in the solution.\n    \n                   \n    \n      On clicking the Yes button, the repository gets updated. This does not update its instance in the solution.\n      Clicking on the No button does NOT update the repository.\n    \n    Upload Modified or Changed items from Business flows to Shared Reposioty \n    Changed or Modifed items can be uploaded to shared repositry by following the same steps as uploading a new item explained above\n    A backup of the existing item is saved in the ‘Pre-Versions’ folder as shown below.\n     \n    \n     \n     \n    Find all instances or usages of the Shared repository item\n     \n    \n      Go to Shared repository section and expand item from shared repository\n      Hover mouse on the expanded item then you will see one link icon\n    \n     \n                     \n     \n    \n      After clicking on this link icon, a new window is opened which displays the list of flows where the item is used\n      The status is displayed to know if the item is updated in the Solution after it was modified in the Shared repository\n    \n             \n            \n     \n    Publish changes from Shared repositry to all instances or usage\n    \n      For any changes in shared repository item, make the required changes as shown in the section Edit Items in Shared Repository\n      Then open the 'Repository Item Usage' window to get the usages in the solution, as explained in previous section\n      Select the desired items and select the Part to Update. Part to update allows to update only selected section. Default part to update is set to All\n      Click on the ‘Update All Selected’ to publish changes to selected usages\n      Then use the ‘Save All Updated Usages’ button to save the changes.\n      This updates the selected instances in the Solution as per changes made in the shared repository.\n      All activity added as ‘Link Instance’ would be updated automatically once any changes made in shared repository’s activity. So for them the Status will be set to NA as default, as There is no need to update explicitly in this case.\n    \n                  \n    De-linking item from Shared repository source\n                 Note: -Only those items can be de-linked which were added from the shared repository. The original items that were used to create a\n                 shared repository cannot be de-linked.\n    \n     \n    \n    \n      Select the desired item in the solution and open it in the Edit window. Click on the orange star as shown below\n      Note: -Only those items can be de-linked which were added from the shared repository.

 \n   \n  Application Models- API Models\n   \n     \n  \n  Introduction\n  \n    Auto Pilot is a new machine-learning-based testing automation functionality.\n            It reduces automatic test flows creation time and helps improve our customers’ quality and time to market.\n    Auto Pilot functionalities enable automatic modeling/learning of application capabilities in 4 model areas – front-end (UI), middle layer (APIs), back-end processes and database.\n    Auto Pilot automatically learns & stores all relevant definitions and capabilities for subsequent automation and reuse in progression automation, users can easily create automated test flows and reduce the efforts of future automation maintenance.\n  \n   \n   \n  Creating new API Model\n  \n     Under the Resources tab, click on the API Model link. Under the Applications Models tab, click on the API Models link as shown below to get the API Model panel.\n  \n  \n                                  \n  \n  \n     Click on the Add button as shown below\n  \n   \n  \n                                   \n  \n  \n  \n  Import WSDL Document\n   \n  \n  \n    In the below window, enter the API URL in the URL text field.

Pilot- Application Model Actions. They are introduced so that parameters can be used across all the Application Models in a solution.\n   \n   \n  How to configure Global parameters?\n  \n    How to Add a global parameter?\n  \n  \n    Go to the Resources tab and click on the ‘Application Models’. \n  \n  Then click on the ‘Models Global Parameters’ link as shown below.\n  \n                    \n           \n  \n  \n    Click on the Add button as shown below\n  \n  \n                     \n  \n  \n    A new window is displayed where the user needs to enter the desired global parameter name and click on the Ok button.\n  \n  \n                     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    As shown below global Parameter ‘GP1’ is added to the grid. The user can then enter its description in the grid.\n  \n  \n                 \n  \n  \n    How to Delete global parameter?\n  \n  A single parameter can be deleted using the ‘-‘ button as shown below\n   \n   \n  \n  \n  All the parameters can be deleted using the ‘Delete All’ button as shown below.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n   \n   How to assign value to the Global Parameter?\n  \n   Global parameters can have 2 values viz Optional and Current.\n   The difference between the two is that the optional value is static and does not change even after the API Action is run.  \n  The Current value is can either be given manually or can be updated during the execution.\n   \n  How to assign Optional values? \n  \n  \n    Click on the button near the Optional Values as shown below.\n  \n      \n  \n  \n  \n    Click on the + button in the new window as shown below.\n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    An entry will be added to the grid. Enter a value in it and click on the Ok button of the window.\n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Users can add multiple such values. Users can also make the added value as default by selecting the ‘Default’ radio button. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    The values will be displayed as shown below.\n  \n  \n    \n   \n  \n    How to assign Current value? \n  \n           \n  \n    From the Global Parameter tab:-\n  \n  Enter the current value in the text box as shown below.\n   \n  \n                  \n            \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    From the Action:-\n  \n  \n    Run the Action once so that values are populated in the Output values tab. \n  \n  Click on the ‘Store To’ dropdown.\n      \n  \n  \n    Select the ApplicationModelParameter option.\n  \n  \n     \n  \n  \n    Click on the ‘{NewGlobalParameter}’  drop down to select the desired parameter.\n  \n  Dropdown is displayed only when there are multiple global parameters added from the ‘Global Parameter’ tab.\n  Click on the Ok button of the Action edit window.\n     \n  \n  \n    When this action is running, the selected global parameter is updated with the output value and will be its current value.\n  \n  \n  \n  As shown in the below example, the Actual value “4.0.30319” will be stored in the global parameter GP1 which will be its current value.\n     \n   \n   \n  \n  \n  \n    How to import optional values from an Excel file?\n     \n  \n  \n    Select the ‘Source Type’ as Excel.\n    Click on the Browse button and select the path of the excel file.\n    Click on the Template button. This will open the file with a sheet by name same as the API model name. \n    The sheet will have the format in which the values need to be entered.\n  \n  \n         \n  \n  \n  \n   \n  Enter the values in the given format. Eg. as shown below values in a row no. 2 are entered manually. Row no. 1 was the heading provided in the \n  template.\n  \n  Note:- The parameter name is case sensitive. Hence only the exact matched parameters will be added.\n  \n                \n             \n   \n  \n  If the Template button was clicked and entries were created in the new sheet then the user has tobrowse the file again to get the latest sheet.\n        Select the template Sheet from the drop-down \n            \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  ‘Select Row(s) Where’ field is displayed. The user can give any condition if required in this field.\n  \n         \n   \n  \n      If a user wants to filter a field that has space in its name then use the below format:-\n        Name in square brackets.\n          [Name]\n  \n          \n   \n  \n   Click on the ‘View All Data’ button to view the content in the sheet. \n  Click on the ‘View Filtered Data’ button to view the data that is filtered after applying the given condition.\n      Click on the Next button once parameters are viewed.\n  \n         \n   \n  \n        The below screen is displayed which will display the list of available parameters that can be added.                                                                                                                                                                    \n           Select the desired parameters and click on the Finish button.\n              \n  \n   \n  Click on the Ok button of the message box.\n       \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  As shown below all the optional values from the Excel file get added to the respective parameter names.\n         \n  \n  \n  \n     \n    How to import optional values from Database?\n  \n  \n  \n    In the ‘Source Type’ select the Database option.\n  \n  There are 2 options, Oracle and MSAccess.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    For Oracle Database, enter the connection string, user id and password. Click on the Connect button.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n     \n     \n  \n   How to Export optional values to an Excel File?\n  \n  \n     Go to Resources-> Applications Models-> Models Global Parameters tab.\n     Click on the ‘Export Parameters to Excel File’ button.\n  \n  \n          \n  \n  \n     A message is displayed on successful export.\n  \n              \n  \n  \n     The file is opened by clicking the Ok button of the above message.\n  \n   This file is stored in the Documents folder of the local PC.\n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n   \n  How to Export optional values to Data Source?\n  \n  \n     Go to Resources-> Applications Models-> Models Global Parameters tab \n     Click on the ‘Export Parameters to DataSource’ button.\n  \n       \n                       \n  \n  \n     Data Source tables are displayed in tree format.

Introduction\n    The purpose of this document is to provide a hands-on step by step user guide for Autopilot Page Objects Model feature and to provide a wide overview on all Page         Objects Model available functions.\n    It is available for Web and Java Platforms.\n     \n     Page Objects Model Wizard\n          There are 2 ways to create a Page Objects Model, first is to create one manually and the second is to let the Ginger learn the Page you’d like to automate, both creations are being done using the Page Objects Model Wizard.\n     \n    Automatic page learn\n    Prerequisites:\n    Solution with at least one Platform Target Application\n    At least one platform agent (e.g. selenium chrome Agent for Web Platform)\n    Site URL which you wish to learn.\n    \n     \n    Go to Resources tab à Applications Models à Page Objects Models.\n    Click the Plus button.\n    \n     \n    Add Page Objects Model Wizard is opened.\n    Click Next Introduction page.\n    Learning Configurations page:\n     Select Target application ---for Web , Mobile, Window and Java\n     (If you don’t have any Web Platform Target Application in your solution, please close the wizard configure a new target application configure \n     one agent, and start over from step 1).\n    \n     \n    For Java Applications:-\n    In order to use the Java agent in the Page Object Model screen, the Java agent needs to be attached to the Java application from the Business Flow tab as shown below.\n     \n    Run the Launch Java Application Action and attach the Java agent to the Java application.\n     \n    Either launch the application using this Action or attach the agent on already launched Java application.\n    \n     \n     \n    In the Add POM wizard, select the Target application as MyJavaApp. The Java agent is automatically populated and is Green indicating that it is On.\n    \n     \n    Learn Specific Frame (Java Driver):\n    \n    Checked Learn Specific Frame, in order to learn specific frame of the selected window.\n    \n     \n    Select Agent (If you don’t have an Agent in your solution, please close the wizard configure a new Selenium agent, and start over from step 1).\n     \n    After selecting the agent, the On/Off button will be enabled. Click it in order to turn on your agent.\n     \n    \n    Now go to the browser instance which been raised by Ginger and navigate to the page URL you would like to learn.\n    \n     \n    When the Agent and its browser instance are opened, the list of Elements Types will be shown on the page.\n     \n    Here you can specify what types of element interesting you in order to create your automation.\n    Once done selecting all desired elements click next.\n    \n     \n    Custom Relative Xpath (Supported Web and Mobile) :\n    On Checked of Custom Xpath Learning Configuration, Custom xpath grid will be visible.\n    You can add multiple XPath format (combine multiple attributes as shown in below SS) in list. During POM learning Ginger will create relative XPath for element, \n    if it match the format.\n    \n    For Example : if you want to create relative xpath of below web element with combination of “placeholder” and “type” attributes. Then xpath format will be //*\n    [@placeholder=’ ‘and @type = ‘ ’].\n    During Learing, ginger will look for attributes mentioned in format for each web element and for matching web elements , it will replace single Quotes (‘ ’) with \n    its original value.\n    For above format relative xpath will be “//*[@placeholder=’First Name’ and @type=’text’]”.\n    \n                  \n     \n                 \n     \n    Learned Object Mapping\n    \n    When reaching to this page the learning process will be automatically started and the Ginger will start to learn all existing elements on the page you were navigated on the previous steps.\n    Indication of the running process would be the spinning orange icon which becomes visible. Also, you will notice that the elements are being added to the mapped elements and unmapped elements grids.\n    The mapping between them is done depending upon the types of elements you selected on the learning configuration page.\n    \n     \n    Selecting any element on the grid will cause the details section to be opened and there you can find all the learned properties and locators of the selected element.\n    \n     \n    If you wish to stop the learning process (reason can be Ginger already learned all relevant elements and there is no reason to continue or you simply want to change the page on the browser instance etc.) you can do it by clicking the stop button.\n    \n     \n    After clicking the stop button, you will be able to restart the learning process by clicking Re-learn button\n    \n     \n    Using the Spy:\n    Click on the Spy button\n    \n     \n    While the Spy is on move your mouse to the requested element on the page and click ctrl.\n    \n      Element not found – re-try 2 or 3 times.\n      An element found – the element will be focused on the elements grid\n      An element found but does not exist on the Element Grid – you will get a button to add the found element to the grid.\n    \n    \n     \n    Click Next.\n                  General Details page:\n    The general details page contains all details which been pulled for the page, here you\n    can change the page name, URL, and screenshot.\n    \n     \n    Click Finish – The Page Objects Model has been added to the Page Objects Model tree.\n     \n          Manual Page Objects Model creation\n     \n    Go to Resources tab à Application Models à Page Objects Models à and Click the Plus button.\n                \n     \n    Add Page Objects Model Wizard is opened.\n    \n    Click Next Introduction page.\n    Check the Manual Radio Button and click Next.\n    \n     \n    Learned Object Mapping:\n    Add Elements By clicking the Plus button\n    \n     \n    Add Locators to your added elements\n    \n     \n    General Details\n    Add Name, Description (optional) and Page URL (optional)\n    \n     \n    Browse and Image for your Page Objects Model (optional)\n    Click Finish, the New Page Objects Model added to the tree.\n     \n            Adding Unmapped Elements to Mapped Elements list and vice-versa\n     \n                If an element is an unmapped list and the user desires to use it in the Actions then follow the below\n                 steps.\n    \n                  Go to the Unmapped Elements tab and select the element.\n                  Click on the ‘Add Elements to mapped list’ button as shown below\n    \n    \n     \n     The element will move to the Mapped Elements tab as shown below\n    \n     \n    The same steps are to be performed while moving the elements from mapped to unmapped tab.\n     \n     \n          Learn Only Mapped Elements\n                 Users can choose an option to learn only mapped elements instead of learning all the elements of the page.\n                 This reduces the learning time. This option is available by default.\n     \n                The user has to uncheck the checkbox if unmapped elements are to be learned.\n               \n     \n     \n          Learning the Elements by Locator’s Priority\n                Users can set the priority of locators of the elements of the page.\n                On the Learning Configurations page, expand the area ‘Learned Elements Locators Preferences’.\n               There are 4 options viz. ById, ByName, ByRelXPath & ByXpath.\n                The sequence of the priority can be changed by using the arrow buttons as indicated below.\n                In this screenshot, when any element will be used in an Action, the Locator used will be ‘ByID’.\n                \n     \n     \n                Users can also change the Locator of a particular element after the page is learned.\n                For this, select the Page Object Model. Go to the UI Elements tab and select the desired element.\n                Expand the Details area. Select the desired locator and using the arrow buttons bring it to priority 1.\n                 \n     \n     \n    Giving Dynamic value to a Locator of the Learned Element\n     \n                  A locator of a learned element can be given a customized value.\n                 For this, select the Page Object Model and go to the UI Elements tab.\n                 Select the desired Element and expand the Details area.\n                 Go to the Locators tab and select the desired locator.\n                 Copy-paste the locator.\n                 The pasted locator can then be edited by either directly typing in the value field or by using the\n                  value expression button ‘…’ as shown below.\n                  \n     \n     \n    Page Objects Model Edit Page\n     \n    Prerequisites:\n    At least one Page Objects Model was created on the Page Objects Model tree.\n     \n    Page Objects Model General Details\n    Go to Resources tab à Application Models à Page Objects Models.\n    Select the Page Objects Model on the tree.\n    \n     \n    On the upper section of the screen, you can change the Page Objects Model name description and the Target Application.\n    Select an Agent to work with and turn it on by clicking the Red button, if the selected Agent is already raised, the button will be automatically green,\n    and no need to re-raise the Agent.\n    \n     \n    By default, the agent will be opened with the specified Page Objects Model Page URL, whenever you need you can navigate to this URL by clicking the Arrow button.\n    \n     \n     \n    Screenshot Tab\n                    Changing the Screenshot can be done by Clicking the Take Screenshot button which will get a screenshot from the current page on the mapped \n                   Agent or by browsing Image from a local file.\n                  \n     \n    UI Elements Tab\n    The page is divided into two :\n    Mapped elements – The elements which we will use to automate our page\n    Unmapped elements – Repository of all unused elements on the page.\n    \n     \n            Clicking the signs icon will shift elements from one group to another\n     \n           \n     \n     \n      Select any element will enable the properties and locators grids in the below section\n       \n     \n     \n    You can test a specific locator by clicking its play button or click the grid’s menu play button to check all locators, the locator\n    statuses will be changed according to the test result.\n    \n     \n     \n    You can test all elements by clicking the Test All Mapped Elements button, this operation will approve your flow will not going to fail because the element cannot be found on the page, here you will have the opportunity to be aware that an element cannot be found before your execution and fix it.\n    If you switch to the unmapped element tab you the button will be changed to test all Unmapped elements.\n    \n     \n    You can add a new locator by clicking the add button, or copy and paste an existing one and then modify it for your needs.\n    \n    The Up and Down buttons will define the priority of the locators, the priority order will be taken into consideration while searching the locator of the page.\n    If you would like to exclude locators from the list just Uncheck its Active field.\n    \n    Note: In automating section explains that in run time all Active locators will be used till the element will be found.\n    \n    You can highlight elements on the open instance of the Agent by clicking the Highlight button.\n    \n     \n    Using the Spy:\n    Click on the Spy button\n    \n     \n    While the Spy is on move your mouse to the requested element on the page and click ctrl.\n    Element not found – re-try 2 or 3 times.\n    An element found – the element will be focused on the elements grid\n    An element found but does not exist on the Element Grid – you will get a button to add the found element to the grid.\n    \n     \n     \n    Notes:\n    Most of the operations (Highlight, Test Elements/Locators, Spy, Go to Page URL, etc.) will work only if the Agent is Selected and turned on.\n    Auto Learned elements cannot be modified or deleted as they take from the page and in order to maintain the page we should keep them as is, manually added elements can be modified and deleted to your need.\n     \n    Update Elements\n                    If the elements of the learned page have been updated then the user can update the elements using the ‘Update Elements’ button\n    1. Select the Page Object Model and go to the UI Elements tab.\n    2. Turn On the Agent and go to the desired page in the agent.\n    3. Click on the ‘Update Elements’ button\n    \n     \n     \n    4. ‘POM Elements Wizard’ is displayed.\n    Expand the ‘New Elements Learning Settings’ and the ‘Learned Elements Locators Preferences’\n    areas to get the details of them.\n    \n     \n    Users can make changes in these areas if desired.\n    Click on the Next button.\n    \n     \n    5. All the elements present on the page are compared with the latest status.\n    In order to map the element which is new and cannot be mapped, Press “Next”\n    \n     \n                   6. A new window “Map deleted element with the new element” is displayed. If there is no deleted element found on the page, then this grid will \n                   be empty.\n    \n    Select the edit option to map the element with new elements found on the page.\n    \n     \n    \n     \n    7. Once the new element got selected, the user can validate the properties and values of existing/deleted elements and newly added elements\n    by selecting the “Compare” option.\n    Also, the properties and locators of a deleted element will be replaced with new values and will avoid breaking the automation flow\n    which was happening earlier.\n    \n     \n     \n    \n     \n      The updated elements will be displayed on the Elements Compare page.\n         The Comparison Status and Comparison Details fields will give the details of it.\n         As shown below, a green check means ‘Unchanged’. The description of the icon will be displayed in the tooltip when the mouse hovers over the \n     icon.\n     \n     \n    Page Objects Model Element’s Values\n                 After the page is learned, select the Page Objects Model on the tree.\n                 Go to the UI Elements tab.\n                As shown in the below screen, the Possible Values field is displayed.\n                The values are also populated from the page if any.\n               As shown in the below screenshot, the selected element has learned the possible values from the page.\n                \n     \n                  Elements that can have values are only allowed eg. Text box, list, etc.\n                 For all the other elements, a warning message is displayed\n                  \n     \n                 To enter the values, click on the ‘…’ button near the possible values field on the require element\n                \n     \n     \n                Click on the + button in the new window\n               \n     \n               User can add multiple values here and set one of them as default and click on the OK button.\n     \n               User can also modify and delete the values from this window.\n                 \n     \n                    The default value will be displayed with a * in the list\n                  \n     \n     \n     \n           Using Page Objects Model for Automate and Execute\n              Automate Using Page Objects Model\n                       Go to Business Flows Tab à Select the desired Business Flow with Web/Java Platform as Target Application.\n    Double click on the Business Flow.\n    Select the desired Activity where you want to add the Action.\n    Expand the Add Actions section\n    \n     \n     \n            Select UIElement Action and click on Add to Actions button to add it.\n               \n     \n                 Double click on the UI element action to open it in Edit mode.\n     \n                  Select “Page Object Model Element” as Locate By. Select your added Page Objects Model in the “Page Object Model”.\n     \n                  Select your desired element as “Model Element” and click on the ‘Select Element’ button.\n    \n     \n    Select the Element Action from the list and populate the value if needed.\n     \n     \n                  Click on Run Action.\n                \n     \n     \n            Automate Using Page Objects Model with Values\n                 Values can be added to Elements either from the Page Objects Model.\n                 Selecting the required element from Page Objects Model as shown below and click on the Select Element button\n    \n     \n    The default value will be populated as shown below. User can also modify this value by typing the desired value in this field.\n     \n     \n

IntroductionAuto Run Configuration is used when the Run set is required to run via command line for automatic execution of Ginger Run set as part of Automation needed or for CI/CD processes integration.How to Create Auto Run Set Configuration?              Go to the Run tab of the solution              Click on the ‘Create Run Set Auto Run Configuration’ button as shown below.                               The Wizard is opened.                                  2.1 General Options Tab                                                                     Download/ Update Solution from source control Note:- This option is disabled if the solution is not downloaded from the source control repository.It is enabled and checked if the solution is from the source control repository. In case checked, Ginger Solution will be downloaded/updated from source control on the execution machine before the execution starts.  Show Run Set execution window while running (on Windows only)This is option is not selected by default. If a user wants to see the execution status in Ginger while the run set is run, then use this option.It displays only the Ginger Run tab. The status of the Run set along with the Runners, Activities and Actions are displayed during the execution as shown below.It is recommended to run without UI for compatibility and performance reasons, for that please keep this option unchecked.  Run Set Analyzer before execution            This option is selected by default. It helps in finding any critical/high design issues in the Business Flow which might impact the execution. In such a case, the execution is not started until the issues are fixed by the user.When this option is unchecked, all the design issues are ignored, and execution starts without any checks.                                      2.2 Configurations Type Tab                                                        ConfigThis option is used to create a config file which is used to execute a run set.It contains the details like the path of the solution, environment name to be used, the Analyzer to be run or not, the run set name and to show the Ginger window or not when execution is going on. The file name and the path can be edited by the user.The default path is the path of the RunsetShortCuts folder inside the solution.    DynamicThe dynamic config file is supported in JSON and XML format, it is recommended to use the JSON format which supports much more flexible configurations.                           JSON Dynamic file supports 2 main modes:Existing Run Set execution configurations- User can specify how exactly an existing Run set will be executed by manipulating it:Runners execution configuration such as Parallel/Sequential, if to stop on failure or not, etc.Applications-Agents mapping- set different Agent than configured on GingerChange selected Environment/sBusiness Flows Active flag for disabling some of the Business FlowsBusiness Flow Input values- can define which value will be set to each input, including Output Values configurationRun set Operations configurations manipulation (currently only Mail Report operation changes is supported)On run time from CLI, Ginger will load the existing Run set, then will manipulate it according to the JSON configurations and then will execute the manipulated Run set.Changes are not been saved to the Run set and have been used only during execution.Note: JSON should include only the nodes of the items (Runners/Business Flows/etc.) which need to be modified on the Run set before execution starts.

If a user does not want to create the run set shortcut but wants to have the Config file, then                             select this option to No. Ginger.exe (Windows only)This option is selected by default. It is used when the run set is to be run on Windows PC and Ginger is already installed on it.The Path of the Ginger.exe is given in the ‘Executer Path’. Generally, it's populated automatically when the path is in Program Files. GingerConsole.dll (Windows/Linux/Mac in case solution is compatible)                               This option is used when a run set is to be run on a Linux/ Mac machine.                                This DLL file can also be used to run on Windows.                                When using in Linux/Mac, the actions in the run set should be compatible with Linux.                               The Ginger.dll should also be available on the machine. The shortcut can be created on the Desktop or in the desired Folder by clicking the Folder option.The Browse button is displayed to select the folder to save in. Shortcut Content PreviewThis shows the full execution command which is stored in the Shortcut in case needed to be used for direct execution on the commands console or be configured in CI/CD processes.  Eg.  How to Trigger Execution via CLI?Once autorun configuration file was created (in one of the above formats Config/JSON/XML/Script, note- in case choose ‘Arguments’ option so config file not needed) you can execute Ginger either by simple execute the shortcut file created by the Wizard or by copying the full command which is in below format:Ginger executer path on the machineConfig file typeConfig

Click on the ‘Create Run Set Auto Run Configuration’ button as shown below.\n       \n    \n        The Wizard is opened.\n                                   \n                      \n      General Options Tab\n    \n       \n     \n                                Explaination for each General Configuration:\n    \n    Download/ Update Solution from source control\n    \n    In case checked, Ginger Solution will be downloaded/updated from source control on the execution machine before the execution starts.\n    Note:- This option is disabled if the solution is not downloaded from the source control repository.\n    It is enabled and checked if the solution is from the source control repository.\n    \n    \n    Show Run Set execution window while running (on Windows only)\n    This is option is not selected by default. If a user wants to see the execution status in Ginger while the run set is run, then use this option.\n    It displays only the Ginger Run tab. The status of the Run set along with the Runners, Activities and Actions are displayed during the execution as \n    shown below.\n    It is recommended to run without UI for compatibility and performance reasons, for that please keep this option unchecked.\n    \n    Run Set Analyzer before execution\n    This option is selected by default. It helps in finding any critical/high design issues in the Business Flow which might impact the execution. \n    In such a case, the execution is not started until the issues are fixed by the user.\n    When this option is unchecked, all the design issues are ignored, and execution starts without any checks.\n     \n    Set ALM Connection details\n    If it is checked and “Publish Execution Results to ALM” is configured in Runset operation. It will publish execution result to respective project \n                                in ALM.\n     \n                          \n     Save Self Healing changes and check-in to source control: If it is checked, it will save changes which is made during self healing operation and will \n     check-in the changes in source control.\n     \n    \n       Artificats Path :  This option is used to store execution results/report on specific path. \n    \n     \n    \n       Execution Configuration Tab\n    \n      Arguments\n    \n     This option does not use any file for the execution configuration but only arguments which can be added to the Ginger execution command line\n    \n    \n      File\n    \n     The file is supported in JSON format, which supports much more flexible configurations. \n     \n     \n     JSON Dynamic file supports 2 main modes:\n    \n      \n        \n          Existing Run Set execution configurations- User can specify how exactly an existing Run set will be executed by manipulating it:\n            \n              Runners execution configuration such as Parallel/Sequential, if to stop on failure or not, etc.\n              Applications-Agents mapping- set different Agent than configured on Ginger\n              Change selected Environment/s\n              Business Flows Active flag for disabling some of the Business Flows\n              Business Flow Input values- can define which value will be set to each input, including Output Values configuration\n              Run set Operations configurations manipulation (currently only Mail Report operation changes is supported)\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n     \n     \n                 On run time from CLI, Ginger will load the existing Run set, then will manipulate it according to the JSON configurations and then will execute the \n     manipulated Run set.Changes are not been saved to the Run set and have been used only during execution.\n     Note: JSON should include only the nodes of the items (Runners/Business Flows/etc.) which need to be modified on the Run set before execution starts.\n     \n     \n                              \n

file on the machine which will hold the execution command for easier automatic execution.\n     The shortcut can be created on the Desktop or in the desired Folder by clicking the Folder option.\n     The Browse button is displayed to select the folder to save in.\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          This option is by default selected to No\n           If a user does not want to create the run set shortcut but wants to have the Config file, then select this option to No\n          Shortcut is available only for Arguments and File configuration options\n        \n      \n    \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      CLI Execution Command\n    \n     This shows the full execution command which is stored in the Shortcut in case needed to be used for direct execution on the commands console or be configured in CI/CD \n     processes. \n     \n                        \n     \n    \n      Execute Now\n    \n      It will allow to start execution in external process as soon as clicking ‘Finish’ button. \n     User can set  1-10 parallel execution sessions.\n     In case of Request: it will send the ginger runset execution  request to Remote/Cloud machine ginger where Execution Handler service ( Execution Service URL) is hosted. \n     \n                   \n     \n    How to Trigger Execution via CLI?\n    Once autorun configuration file was created (in one of the above formats Config/JSON/XML/Script, note- in case choose ‘Arguments’ option so config file \n    not needed) you can execute Ginger either by simple execute the shortcut file created by the Wizard or by copying the full command which is in below \n    format:\n    \n      Ginger executer path on the machine\n      Config file type\n      Config file path\n    \n    \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Amdocs\\Ginger by amdocs\\Ginger.exe\" dynamic --filename \"C:\\Ginger Solutions\\Cloud\\TDMTestSolution\\Documents\\RunSetShortCuts\\TDM-\n    Demo-BP_Create.Ginger.AutoRunConfigs.json\"\n    Open CMD console paste the command and click Enter, you will see that Ginger execution started and aal execution details appear on Console logs:\n     \n                 \n     \n                \n

It executes the runset irrespective of failure of any Action. All the Actions are executed.\n    Stop Business Flows Run on Failure: - during the execution when an Action fails, the whole execution is stopped. Further Actions/Activities are not executed.\n    Run in simulation mode checkbox can be used when we require to execute the runset in simulation mode. This helps when certain testing components are not ready for execution, and we use simulated responses in place of actual ones.\n    Target application/Agent can be selected here. \n  \n              \n  \n  The specific environment can be selected using the checkbox and the list of environments will be displayed in the dropdown.\n      \n  \n  \n  Filter Execution by Tags checkbox can be used.

Activities, Variables, and Configurations.\n    \n     \n    Activities groups: Activities are created under the Activities group. It is this entity that is exported to ALM (QC) as a test case. Activities can be stored in a shared repository, which can be used in other business flows in the solution.\n    \n     \n    Activities: An activity is added inside an Activity Group. Actions are then added inside the Activities.\n                               \n     \n    Variables: This is the area where the Business Flow variables are created. There are different types of variables, such as String, list, dynamic, password, and a random string. Variables can be used in the Actions.\n                              \n     \n    Configurations: This is the area where the Business Flow Configuration is created and displayed. The name, description, and target applications can be added here.\n                            \n     \n    When the user double-clicks Flow 1, the Automation area is displayed where the Activities group, Activities, and Actions are created.\n              \n     \n                          Tools of the Business Flows area:\n              \n     \n     adds a new business flow.\n     \n     saves any updates made in the current business flow.\n     \n     \n     allows identifying any missing configuration in the flows, such as missing locale or missing flow control action. Also helps determine whether any action in the flow is obsolete and should be upgraded.\n     \n    \n    Extra Operations is used to export a business flow to a CSV file.\n     \n    Other components of the main toolbar:\n    \n    Find & Replace In Solution, , is used to find and replace business flows, activities, actions, variables, Run Set & Application Model, and other entities.\n    Share
