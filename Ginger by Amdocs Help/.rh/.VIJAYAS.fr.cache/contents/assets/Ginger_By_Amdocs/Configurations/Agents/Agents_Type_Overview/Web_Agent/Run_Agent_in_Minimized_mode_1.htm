     This functionality is available only for the Chrome and Firefox Agents.
     When the Agent is run (either from Automate tab or the Runset tab), it is not visible.
     Only its console is visible.
     In the Agent’s Driver Configuration, the parameter ‘BrowserMinimized’ has to be made as ‘true’.
        ‎
     By default, it is marked as false.
        ‎This mode is used when the user wants to work on some other window while the Ginger execution is running.
