  Read Text from Table - PDF
  If your PDF contains text in a tabular format, you can read data from specific columns in it using this operation
   
                                   
  You specify the row number (counting from 0) which you wish read in that specific column, alternatively you can specify a condition as shown below. This basically translates to: Read from Column abc where value of Column abc2 = 1.
