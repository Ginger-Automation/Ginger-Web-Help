  How to execute runners in Parallel mode? 
  
                       As shown below, after clicking on this button below window displays, and from there you can select parallel. The runner 
  parallelly i.e., all runners will be executed at once. This feature is useful when we have to execute testing on a website but with different 
  browsers. The parallel execution, in this case, will save time.
  
                       
  
  
                       
            
   
                         It will show the result like below where you can see Runner 1& Runner 2 executed parallelly that’s why their times are the same i.e., 12
  sec.
  
                         
  
  
             How to do Sequential execution? 
  
  As shown below, after clicking on this button below window displays, and from there you can select Sequential. The run set can be
   run sequentially using the button as shown below. The execution with starts with 1st runner, then 2nd runner, and so on. In this 
  mode, I am required when there is a dependency between runners like the output of Runner1 is going to impact the execution of 
  runner2 or whenthe parallel execution is not required.
  
               
  
              
                        
              
  
                         
   Above you can see the 1st runner is running so that’s why their time of 4 sec is there and 2nd runner is waiting for  completion of 1st runner 
  so that’s why their time is 0 sec.
  
  
  
     How to select Environment? 
      The environment can be selected from the drop-down as shown below. This is populated.   as per the environments added in the 
  solution tab.
          
  
   
  Runners Manipulations (Add/Delete/Move/Sync)
  
               Add Runner 
  
                Using the below button, you can add a new runner to the frame.
                 
  
                  Delete Runner
   
                As shown below button deletes the selected runner. You can also delete multiple Runners at a time.
  
               
  
               A confirmation message is populated, clicking on the ‘Yes’ button deletes the runner.
              
  
  
  
  Move Runner
  
                The runner’s position can be changed, and this is important when we have to execute the runset sequentially. To do this we have 2 buttons
   Select the runner and click on the button as shown below to shift the runner to your left or right.
                
  
   
  Sync/ Unsync Runner
  
                     There are 2 options: -
                        1. Sync
                   The below button indicates the Sync option which is selected by default.
                 
  
  
  
                     As shown below, the execution of Business Flow/Activity/Action which is highlighted is
                     only going on. The user will not be able to highlight to any other Business. 
                     Flow/Activity/Action which is not under execution. 
                     This helps to know which Business Flow/Activity/Action is under execution currently.
  
                        
  
                                              
                    2.Un-sync
       
                          The below button indicates the Un-Sync option.
                           
  
                         As shown below, the user can highlight any Business Flow/Activity/Action irrespective of 
           which Business Flow/Activity/Action execution is going on. 
                         This helps the user to navigate to a Business Flow/Activity/Action which has failed 
                         to check how it failed.
                                           
                                                
                                                 
  
         Expand/ Collapse All the Runners
  
      Click on the button as shown below to collapse or to expand the Runners area so that the Activities/Actions can be viewed in full 
  coverage. This feature is specially used during the execution when the user wants to     know which Action is in progress.
            
             After collapsing below screen is displayed.
  
           
  
  
   Active/ Inactive All the Runners
             As shown below, this button is used to.

    Continue Business Flows Run on Failure: - this is by default option. It executes the runset irrespective of failure of any Action. All the Actions are executed.
    Stop Business Flows Run on Failure: - during the execution when an Action fails, the whole execution is stopped. Further Actions/Activities are not executed.
    Run in simulation mode checkbox can be used when we require to execute the runset in simulation mode. This helps when certain testing components are not ready for execution, and we use simulated responses in place of actual ones.
    Target application/Agent can be selected here. 
  
              
  
  The specific environment can be selected using the checkbox and the list of environments will be displayed in the dropdown.
      
  
  
  Filter Execution by Tags checkbox can be used. You can edit or you can add Solutions Tags from there.

  Configure Business Flow (Output Variables can be used)
  
  
                 Click on the Settings icon as shown below to get the Business Flow configuration
                                
                              
                
  
                            
                  Below window will be displayed giving the details of the Business Flow.
                 The variables can be mapped to Values at Runtime by selecting the options given (None, Output 
                  variable, DataSource). Only the valid variable types will have these options to be selected.
  
                            
                 
  
                 Business Flow can be configured in three ways:
  
  
    Passing variables in different business flows with the same variable name.
  
  Note: This will work only when the Runset is executed in Sequential manner. It will not work if the Runset is 
  executed in Parallel manner.
  
  For this first you need to add variable from add variable option.
      
              
  
             
             
             
       
             
    Name the variable add the value and main part is here you have click checkbox for ‘Set as input’ and ‘Set as output’.
         
            
  
   
  
     We can use the same variable in different business flows.                          
  
  
                             
  
  
     On selecting the ‘Configure Business Flow’ icon from the ‘Provide’ flow, we will get the following window. In this, select the dropdown to get the list of variables.
  
  
  
     In the dropdown, the user can choose the variable value retrieved from different business flows differentiated with the variable name flowed by business flow name. 
  
                  
  
        2.Variable name used in same business flow multiple times.
  
               We can use the same business flow multiple times in the process.
  
        
  
  
    On selecting the ‘Configure Business Flow’ icon from the ‘Provide’ flow, we will get the following window. In this, select the dropdown to get the list of variables
  
  
  
    To differentiate between the output variables passed with the same name, runtime values can be mapped with the business flow name followed by the number at which flow is executed.
  
             
  
  
    Since the latest value of the variable is updated by the last flow in sequence, flow 1 (1) will appear below the Create flow 1 (2).
  
  
  
  3.Same variable name used across different runners
  
  
    While using the same variable in different runners as shown below. 
  
   
  Runner 1 – 
  
        
   
   Runner 2- 
  
        
  
  Runner 3-
     
  
  
    On selecting the ‘Configure Business Flow’ icon from the ‘Provide’ flow, we will get the following window. In this, select the dropdown to get the list of variables
  
  
  
       
  
    The output variable can be differentiated based on the runner name as listed above. Users can choose the output variable value based on the runner name.
