It allows for running your tests in a distributed test execution environment.\n    When to Use it?\n    There are two reasons why you might want to use Selenium-Grid.\n    To run your tests against multiple browsers, multiple versions of browsers and browsers running on different operating systems.\n    To reduce the time it takes for the test suite to complete a test pass\n     \n    \n     \n    Information on Selenium Grid can be found at:\n    http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/07_selenium_grid.jsp#\n    https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Grid2\n    http://www.guru99.com/introduction-to-selenium-grid.html\n     \n    Create New Solution\n                      Default Ginger Data Source will be added to every new solution with the Name “GingerDataSource”. The           MDB file for the Data Source will be copied to the Data Sources Folder of the Solution in the File System.\n     \n     \n    Running Selenium Grid\n     \n    Configuring Selenium Grid Agent\n     \n    Go to Configurations Tab-> Agent and click on the ‘+’ button as shown below.\n    \n     \n     \n    In the below wizard enter the Agent name. Select the Platform type as Web and Driver Type as SeleniumRemoteWebDriver.\n    Click on the Next button\n     \n     \n    \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n    On the Selenium Grid Hub field enter the IP where you wants to configure your hub, if you running your hub on your local machine you can leave it untouched with the default value otherwise specify your hub IP and port and make sure to keep it with the same format HTTP://<IP>:<Port>.\n    \n     \n    On the Browser Name field, select the specific browser you want the agent to run on.\n    Note: Safari agent can be executed on Mac only.\n    Note: Edge can be installed on Windows 10 only.\n    Browser Version (Optional) – if not specified it will refer to any.\n    On the Platform field select the specific Platform you want the agent to run on.\n    Node for all will create a generic node for all browsers available in the selected platform.\n     \n    Starting the Hub and Nodes\n    After configuring your agent, click on both Create Hub Installation package and Create Node Installation package.\n    \n     \n    Once clicked a new Dialog box will be started with both Zips files, extract them on your local or the remote machine.\n    Start hub by executing the starthub.bat, leave the window open for your execution.\n    \n     \n    Start the node by executing the startnode.bat file on your local or your remote machine and leave the window open for your execution.\n    \n     \n     \n     \n    This will raise a generic node that fits up to 5 instances from any of the chosen browsers.\n    The Node is being executed with a Random Port, it might be that the port is already taken, if this is the case you can simply create a new node by clicking the node button and execute the new startnode.bat file.\n     \n    If you wish to execute the test on more Machines/Browsers you need to create new nodes by clicking the Create node installation package and executing the new startnode.bat file.\n    \n     \n    Checking console\n     \n    After starting the hub and nodes you may switch to the Console tab to check for your hub and node status.\n    \n     \n    Return to the Configuration tab and click on Test Agent Configuration button, expected result – the browser Instance is started and the success message is pop upped.\n    \n     \n    Map your web target application to your new agent and execute your test.\n     \n    Note: If you wish to execute multiple browsers in parallel you need to configure one agent for each browser.\n    Note: Safari configuration has few more steps:\n    Download Safari driver from http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/\n    Open the driver with Safari and do to SafariPreferences  check the Show Develop menu checkbox  Go to Develop and click Allow Remote Automation\n     \n

Enter the name, platform as Unix. Click on Add button to associate a Tag if required. Click on the Next button.   Enter the mandatory connection details like the Host, user name and password. Click on ‘Test Agent Configuration’ button. Connection successful message is display if connection is a success.Click on the Finish button to add the Agent.                                How to map Unix Agent?                           In order to use this Agent for the execution, we have to map the Agent to the Business Flows.                          When a new solution is created, the default Agent is already mapped to the Business Flow. Mapping agent to the Business FlowGo to the Business Flows tab and double click on the required Business Flow.Click on the ‘Change Agent Mapping’ button as shown below.  The below window will be displayed where only those agents will be displayed whose platform type is same as the target application platform type.Select the desired agent and click on the Map button to map the agent.

To do so:Open Putty genLoad the already generated private key (.ppk) by clicking on the “load” button                            After loading the private key, select “Export OpenSSH Key” option from the tab “Conversions”.              Save this Open ssh format private key in a file.Now, use this private key at all the source servers by pasting it under “id_rsa” file under “.ssh” directory for the user.Make sure the file “id_rsa” has permissions of 600 (only write & read permissions for the owner) Note:Also, make sure the home directory of the user doesn’t have write permissions for groups & others.   Note: We have to manually update the private key in all the source servers  How to Create PrivateKey for RSA Bypass? Generate a private public key set using putty key generator software   Store the private key using “Save private key” option. Copy the text from “Public key for pasting into ssh….. “ box and save the content as  public  key .   Log into your unix box using RSA token. Check if  .ssh directory is already created , if it is not there create the directory using Command : mkdir .sshChange permissions using commandCommand : chmod 710  .sshIn case the directory is already there just change the permissions. Now go inside .ssh directory  and check for authorized_keys file. If the file is there open it in vi mode and paste the content of public key inside it , change its permissions to 750.If not then create authorized_keys file, change its permission and open the file in vi mode and  add the content inside it  save it and quit the file.Command : touch  authorized_keysChange permissions using commandCommand : chmod 750  authorized_keys   Once the setup is done every time we log in we need to upload  the Private key(.ppk) into putty session  as shown below.  Note:  In order to SSH connection work your home directory(i.e the folder under which .ssh is present)  should never have 777 permissions.

Either MS Access or a Ginger data source can be used.Documents are a folder in the Ginger Solution folder and are used to store all documents related to the solution. Use it to store scripts, templates, and output files. Plugins are third-party add-ons for capabilities that extend Ginger.

YOURSELF\n     \n     \n                OBJECTIVE:\n    This exercise will help you automate a small flow using GINGER.\n    Here we will see the steps on how we automate the flow of launching URL http://abeat.amdocs.com and logging in with some credentials.\n    Also, we will understand customizing the execution report as per our requirement.\n     \n               To create a solution click on the drop-down as shown below and select the ‘Create New Solution’ option.\n     \n    \n     \n     \n    In the pop window, enter the name of the solution (as shown below) browse to the location of the folder where you wish to save your solution.\n     \n    \n     \n    Since we are automating a website flow select the application as “MywebApp” and platform as “WEB”. With a click on create, a solution is created successfully.\n     \n               This will load the solution as shown below.\n    \n     \n     \n               Go to the Configurations tab and click on Agents.\n    In the left panel, the agent is automatically created for the “MyWebApp”.\n    The default driver for the WebApp application is Internet Explorer “SeleniumIE” and the driver type can be changed if needed using the dropdown.\n     \n    \n     \n               Once the solution and agent are created, double click on the Business flow and it will take you to the automation area.\n    In this window, you will see various sections like Activities Group, Activity-Variables and Actions.\n    By default, Activity1 is added as shown below.\n    \n     \n     \n               Go back to the Business Flow by clicking the back arrow at the left top corner.\n    Click on the Variables tab, Business Flow variables are added here.\n    Click on the + sign to create a new variable that can be used in all the Activities within the Business Flow.\n    \n     \n    Here we will use the variable to give the name of the website which we intend to open as part of our automation flow.\n    Select the variable type from the list shown like in our case the website name will be a variable string as highlighted in the list below. Click on Add Variable.\n    \n     \n    Variables get added.\n    \n     \n    Double click on it to open it on the Edit page.\n    Enter the name as “Website” and the string value as http://abeat.amdocs.com since this is the URL we will open as part of automation as shown below.\n    \n     \n                 Now we need to add action using the + sign in the action section. Actions are executables on various platforms.\n    First, double-click on the Business Flow to go to the Automate tab.\n    Then click on the + button as shown below.\n    \n     \n    Click on the Actions Library as shown below\n    \n     \n    Platform-specific actions are displayed here. Since we have chosen a platform as a website, web-related actions will be displayed.\n    General Actions are not platform-specific.\n    Since we want to launch a website in this URL, we will select “Browser Action” and click on the arrow button as shown below.\n    \n     \n    Double click on the added action to open it in edit mode.\n    Select the ‘Operation Type’ as ‘Goto URL’\n    \n     \n    Since we have assigned the website name in a variable we will browse that variable name in the URL textbox. For this click on the “…” button near the URL textbox as shown below.\n    Double click the ‘Website’ variable on the left pane.
