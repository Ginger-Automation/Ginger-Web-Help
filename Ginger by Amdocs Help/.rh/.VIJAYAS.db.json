Remote Web Driver\n     \n    Contents\n    1. What is Selenium-Grid?\n    1.1 When to Use it?\n    1.2 Create New Solution\n    2. Running Selenium Grid\n    2.1 Configuring Selenium Grid Agent\n    2.2 Starting the Hub and Nodes\n    2.3 Checking console\n     \n     \n    ‎\n    What is Selenium-Grid?\n    Selenium-Grid allows you to run your tests on different machines against different browsers in parallel. That is, running multiple tests at the same time against different machines running different browsers and operating systems. Essentially, Selenium-Grid supports distributed test execution. It allows for running your tests in a distributed test execution environment.\n    When to Use it?\n    There are two reasons why you might want to use Selenium-Grid.\n    To run your tests against multiple browsers, multiple versions of browsers and browsers running on different operating systems.\n    To reduce the time it takes for the test suite to complete a test pass\n     \n    \n     \n    Information on Selenium Grid can be found at:\n    http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/07_selenium_grid.jsp#\n    https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Grid2\n    http://www.guru99.com/introduction-to-selenium-grid.html\n     \n    Create New Solution\n                      Default Ginger Data Source will be added to every new solution with the Name “GingerDataSource”. The           MDB file for the Data Source will be copied to the Data Sources Folder of the Solution in the File System.\n     \n     \n    Running Selenium Grid\n     \n    Configuring Selenium Grid Agent\n     \n    Go to Configurations Tab-> Agent and click on the ‘+’ button as shown below.\n    \n     \n     \n    In the below wizard enter the Agent name. Select the Platform type as Web and Driver Type as SeleniumRemoteWebDriver.\n    Click on the Next button\n     \n     \n    \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n    On the Selenium Grid Hub field enter the IP where you wants to configure your hub, if you running your hub on your local machine you can leave it untouched with the default value otherwise specify your hub IP and port and make sure to keep it with the same format HTTP://<IP>:<Port>.\n    \n     \n    On the Browser Name field, select the specific browser you want the agent to run on.\n    Note: Safari agent can be executed on Mac only.\n    Note: Edge can be installed on Windows 10 only.\n    Browser Version (Optional) – if not specified it will refer to any.\n    On the Platform field select the specific Platform you want the agent to run on.\n    Node for all will create a generic node for all browsers available in the selected platform.\n     \n    Starting the Hub and Nodes\n    After configuring your agent, click on both Create Hub Installation package and Create Node Installation package.\n    \n     \n    Once clicked a new Dialog box will be started with both Zips files, extract them on your local or the remote machine.\n    Start hub by executing the starthub.bat, leave the window open for your execution.\n    \n     \n    Start the node by executing the startnode.bat file on your local or your remote machine and leave the window open for your execution.\n    \n     \n     \n     \n    This will raise a generic node that fits up to 5 instances from any of the chosen browsers.\n    The Node is being executed with a Random Port, it might be that the port is already taken, if this is the case you can simply create a new node by clicking the node button and execute the new startnode.bat file.\n     \n    If you wish to execute the test on more Machines/Browsers you need to create new nodes by clicking the Create node installation package and executing the new startnode.bat file.\n    \n     \n    Checking console\n     \n    After starting the hub and nodes you may switch to the Console tab to check for your hub and node status.\n    \n     \n    Return to the Configuration tab and click on Test Agent Configuration button, expected result – the browser Instance is started and the success message is pop upped.\n    \n     \n    Map your web target application to your new agent and execute your test.\n     \n    Note: If you wish to execute multiple browsers in parallel you need to configure one agent for each browser.\n    Note: Safari configuration has few more steps:\n    Download Safari driver from http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/\n    Open the driver with Safari and do to SafariPreferences  check the Show Develop menu checkbox  Go to Develop and click Allow Remote Automation\n     \n

Click on Open Button   Connecting UNIX server from another Unix server without RSA/password                For ATT projects, we can use their portal to publish the public key to all the servers which are defined under the role.                   4.2.1 Updating public key at all the target servers                  Login to below link and update your Public Key.

Enter your ATT UID and paste public key (openSSH format) in SSH_KEY                               Note: Once you update public key on above link, It Will take 24 to 48 hour time to get access other               servers.                 4.2.2 Updating private key in all the source servers                 First, get the openssh format private key from the putty gen. To do so:Open Putty genLoad the already generated private key (.ppk) by clicking on the “load” button                            After loading the private key, select “Export OpenSSH Key” option from the tab “Conversions”.              Save this Open ssh format private key in a file.Now, use this private key at all the source servers by pasting it under “id_rsa” file under “.ssh” directory for the user.Make sure the file “id_rsa” has permissions of 600 (only write & read permissions for the owner) Note:Also, make sure the home directory of the user doesn’t have write permissions for groups & others.   Note: We have to manually update the private key in all the source servers  How to Create PrivateKey for RSA Bypass? Generate a private public key set using putty key generator software   Store the private key using “Save private key” option. Copy the text from “Public key for pasting into ssh….. “ box and save the content as  public  key .   Log into your unix box using RSA token. Check if  .ssh directory is already created , if it is not there create the directory using Command : mkdir .sshChange permissions using commandCommand : chmod 710  .sshIn case the directory is already there just change the permissions. Now go inside .ssh directory  and check for authorized_keys file. If the file is there open it in vi mode and paste the content of public key inside it , change its permissions to 750.If not then create authorized_keys file, change its permission and open the file in vi mode and  add the content inside it  save it and quit the file.Command : touch  authorized_keysChange permissions using commandCommand : chmod 750  authorized_keys   Once the setup is done every time we log in we need to upload  the Private key(.ppk) into putty session  as shown below.  Note:  In order to SSH connection work your home directory(i.e the folder under which .ssh is present)  should never have 777 permissions.

Check if .ssh directory is already created , if it is not there create the directory using\n    Command : mkdir .ssh\n    Change permissions using command\n    Command : chmod 710 .ssh\n    In case the directory is already there just change the permissions.\n     \n    Now go inside .ssh directory and check for authorized_keys file. If the file is there open it in vi mode and paste the content of public key inside it , change its permissions to 750.\n    If not then create authorized_keys file, change its permission and open the file in vi mode and add the content inside it save it and quit the file.\n    Command : touch authorized_keys\n    Change permissions using command\n    Command : chmod 750 authorized_keys\n     \n     \n    Once the setup is done every time we log in we need to upload the Private key(.ppk) into putty session as shown below.\n     \n    \n     \n    Note: In order to SSH connection work your home directory(i.e the folder under which .ssh is present) should never have 777 permissions.\n     \n     \n

that can be loaded and executed in Ginger. When starting your work in Ginger, create a solution first. \n    To create a new solution, select Create New Solution. To open an existing solution, click Test and select Open Existing Solution. \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n    Business Flows tab\n    This tab displays all business flows of a solution. It also displays the automation items available in a business flow, such as the activities, activities groups, variables, configurations, and actions.\n    \n    \n      A business flow is a group of activities that define at least one end-to-end function flow or test scenario. The screenshot below shows how a new BAN is created in a telecom application. It shows the name, description, target application, and other details of the business flow.\n      When you double-click Flow 1, the tab will display the Automation area, with the actions, variables, activities groups, and activities created.\n      To go to the Automation area, click the Automate button in the panel on the right:\n    \n    \n    \n    The following are parts of the automation area:\n    \n      An Activity is a set of actions that address a particular functional requirement as part of a business flow. A business flow can contain multiple activities. \n      The Actions tab presents actions, which are the steps taken by the user or system.\n      The Variables tab is the area where new variables can be added.\n      The Configurations tab shows the configuration of the selected activity.\n      The + button opens the area from where actions can be added and other things like Spy, shared repository, and API models can be used.\n    \n    \n    Run tab\n    The is the area where run sets are created for execution. For more details, refer to Library -> Solution -> Run Sets of Ginger Help Index.\n    \n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    Configurations tab\n    All configuration-related items are created in this tab.\n    \n    \n    \n      Target Applications presents the applications (Web, Unix, Java, and so on) on which the executable actions will be run.\n      Agents are the drivers used for recording a test and for running the target application under test.\n      Internal Browser is used for recording a web application. It is an in-built and customized form of Internet Explorer. Selenium IE, Firefox, and Chrome drivers allow running scripts in these respective browsers, and they are launched as separate browsers.\n      Reports is where the test results are displayed.\n      Use Tags to create tags that identify a set of automation items.\n    \n    \n     \n    Resources tab\n    All resource-related items can be created in this tab.\n    \n    \n    \n      Shared Repository stores all automation items of a shared repository in the solution. These items can be used in other business flows present in the same solution.\n      Application Models contains Auto Pilot, which is a testing automation functionality that is based on machine learning. Auto Pilot functionalities enable automatic modeling and learning of application capabilities in four model areas: front-end (UI), middle layer (APIs), back-end processes, and database.\n      Use Environments to store global details that will be used across multiple businesses flows present in a solution. Also use Environments to store database connection details, login credentials, Unix server details, and any general parameters that will be used globally.\n      Use Global Variables to create all variables that will be used in the business flows present in the solution.\n      Data Sources is the database internally used by Ginger. Either MS Access or a Ginger data source can be used.\n      Documents are a folder in the Ginger Solution folder and are used to store all documents related to the solution. Use it to store scripts, templates, and output files. \n      Plugins are third-party add-ons for capabilities that extend Ginger. \n    \n    \n    \n

  \n     \n                Objective:\n    This exercise will help you automate a small flow using GINGER.\n    Here we will see the steps on how we automate the flow of launching URL http://abeat.amdocs.com and logging in with some credentials.\n    Also, we will understand customizing the execution report as per our requirement.\n     \n               To create a solution click on the drop-down as shown below and select the ‘Create New Solution’ option.\n     \n    \n     \n     \n    In the pop window, enter the name of the solution (as shown below) browse to the location of the folder where you wish to save your solution.\n     \n    \n     \n    Since we are automating a website flow select the application as “MywebApp” and platform as “WEB”. With a click on create, a solution is created successfully.\n     \n               This will load the solution as shown below.\n    \n     \n     \n               Go to the Configurations tab and click on Agents.\n    In the left panel, the agent is automatically created for the “MyWebApp”.\n    The default driver for the WebApp application is Internet Explorer “SeleniumIE” and the driver type can be changed if needed using the dropdown.\n     \n    \n     \n               Once the solution and agent are created, double click on the Business flow and it will take you to the automation area.\n    In this window, you will see various sections like Activities Group, Activity-Variables and Actions.\n    By default, Activity1 is added as shown below.\n    \n     \n     \n               Go back to the Business Flow by clicking the back arrow at the left top corner.\n    Click on the Variables tab, Business Flow variables are added here.\n    Click on the + sign to create a new variable that can be used in all the Activities within the Business Flow.\n    \n     \n    Here we will use the variable to give the name of the website which we intend to open as part of our automation flow.\n    Select the variable type from the list shown like in our case the website name will be a variable string as highlighted in the list below. Click on Add Variable.\n    \n     \n    Variables get added.\n    \n     \n    Double click on it to open it on the Edit page.\n    Enter the name as “Website” and the string value as http://abeat.amdocs.com since this is the URL we will open as part of automation as shown below.\n    \n     \n                 Now we need to add action using the + sign in the action section. Actions are executables on various platforms.\n    First, double-click on the Business Flow to go to the Automate tab.\n    Then click on the + button as shown below.\n    \n     \n    Click on the Actions Library as shown below\n    \n     \n    Platform-specific actions are displayed here. Since we have chosen a platform as a website, web-related actions will be displayed.\n    General Actions are not platform-specific.\n    Since we want to launch a website in this URL, we will select “Browser Action” and click on the arrow button as shown below.\n    \n     \n    Double click on the added action to open it in edit mode.\n    Select the ‘Operation Type’ as ‘Goto URL’\n    \n     \n    Since we have assigned the website name in a variable we will browse that variable name in the URL textbox. For this click on the “…” button near the URL textbox as shown below.\n    Double click the ‘Website’ variable on the left pane. The variable gets added in the editor area and clicks the Ok button of the ‘Value Expression Editor’ window and the Action window.\n    \n     \n               Now run the action by clicking on RUN ACTION and the agent will automatically be launched.\n    \n      ‎\n    And you will see the URL opened as below.\n    \n     \n               To record a particular flow, expand the Record area by clicking on the Record as shown below.\n    \n     \n    Click on the Record button as shown below\n    \n     \n    Now go back to the browser window and enter the credentials as shown below\n    \n     \n    Stop the recording once the flow to be captured is done by clicking on the Stop button.\n    \n     \n    Once the recording is completed, one can also see the set of recorded actions in the activity action tab.\n    \n     \n    One can change the name of the action by double-clicking on the action and giving a relevant name as below.\n    \n     \n    Also, put some wait time between actions wherever necessary in the wait text box as shown in the screenshot above.\n    \n     \n               Now to create a run set, go to the RUN tab.\n    \n     \n    Click on the + button as shown by the arrow below to add the required Business Flows.\n    In the displayed window, select the Business Flow and click on the Select button.\n    \n     \n     \n    The Activities & Actions in the Business Flow get added to the Run set.\n    \n     \n    Now go to the Operations tab in the Run set\n    Here you can send the report that will be sent once the execution is completed.\n     \n    \n     \n    Once the report is configured save the run set.\n    \n     \n    To run the run set, click on the RUN button as shown below.\n    \n     \n    One can see the progress of the execution by the status displayed at the corner of the business flows, activities and actions as shown below.\n    \n     \n    Once the execution is complete a mail is sent showing the outcome of passed and failed test cases like below. It also shows the run set details with the execution start and ends time.\n    There is also a zipped HTML with the mail containing the HTML report with all the details like below.\n    \n

IntroductionAuto Run Configuration is used when the Run set is required to run via command line for automatic execution of Ginger Run set as part of Automation needed or for CI/CD processes integration.How to Create Auto Run Set Configuration?              Go to the Run tab of the solution              Click on the ‘Create Run Set Auto Run Configuration’ button as shown below.                               The Wizard is opened.                                  2.1 General Options Tab                                                                     Download/ Update Solution from source control Note:- This option is disabled if the solution is not downloaded from the source control repository.It is enabled and checked if the solution is from the source control repository. In case checked, Ginger Solution will be downloaded/updated from source control on the execution machine before the execution starts.  Show Run Set execution window while running (on Windows only)This is option is not selected by default. If a user wants to see the execution status in Ginger while the run set is run, then use this option.It displays only the Ginger Run tab. The status of the Run set along with the Runners, Activities and Actions are displayed during the execution as shown below.It is recommended to run without UI for compatibility and performance reasons, for that please keep this option unchecked.  Run Set Analyzer before execution            This option is selected by default. It helps in finding any critical/high design issues in the Business Flow which might impact the execution. In such a case, the execution is not started until the issues are fixed by the user.When this option is unchecked, all the design issues are ignored, and execution starts without any checks.                                      2.2 Configurations Type Tab                                                        ConfigThis option is used to create a config file which is used to execute a run set.It contains the details like the path of the solution, environment name to be used, the Analyzer to be run or not, the run set name and to show the Ginger window or not when execution is going on. The file name and the path can be edited by the user.The default path is the path of the RunsetShortCuts folder inside the solution.    DynamicThe dynamic config file is supported in JSON and XML format, it is recommended to use the JSON format which supports much more flexible configurations.                           JSON Dynamic file supports 2 main modes:Existing Run Set execution configurations- User can specify how exactly an existing Run set will be executed by manipulating it:Runners execution configuration such as Parallel/Sequential, if to stop on failure or not, etc.Applications-Agents mapping- set different Agent than configured on GingerChange selected Environment/sBusiness Flows Active flag for disabling some of the Business FlowsBusiness Flow Input values- can define which value will be set to each input, including Output Values configurationRun set Operations configurations manipulation (currently only Mail Report operation changes is supported)On run time from CLI, Ginger will load the existing Run set, then will manipulate it according to the JSON configurations and then will execute the manipulated Run set.Changes are not been saved to the Run set and have been used only during execution.Note: JSON should include only the nodes of the items (Runners/Business Flows/etc.) which need to be modified on the Run set before execution starts.

If a user does not want to create the run set shortcut but wants to have the Config file, then                             select this option to No. Ginger.exe (Windows only)This option is selected by default. It is used when the run set is to be run on Windows PC and Ginger is already installed on it.The Path of the Ginger.exe is given in the ‘Executer Path’. Generally, it's populated automatically when the path is in Program Files. GingerConsole.dll (Windows/Linux/Mac in case solution is compatible)                               This option is used when a run set is to be run on a Linux/ Mac machine.                                This DLL file can also be used to run on Windows.                                When using in Linux/Mac, the actions in the run set should be compatible with Linux.                               The Ginger.dll should also be available on the machine. The shortcut can be created on the Desktop or in the desired Folder by clicking the Folder option.The Browse button is displayed to select the folder to save in. Shortcut Content PreviewThis shows the full execution command which is stored in the Shortcut in case needed to be used for direct execution on the commands console or be configured in CI/CD processes.  Eg.  How to Trigger Execution via CLI?Once autorun configuration file was created (in one of the above formats Config/JSON/XML/Script, note- in case choose ‘Arguments’ option so config file not needed) you can execute Ginger either by simple execute the shortcut file created by the Wizard or by copying the full command which is in below format:Ginger executer path on the machineConfig file typeConfig

How to Trigger Execution via CLI?\n    \n    \n        ‎ \n    Introduction\n     Auto Run Configuration is used when the Run set is required to run via command line for automatic execution of Ginger Run set as part of Automation needed or for CI/CD processes integration.\n    How to Create Auto Run Set Configuration?\n     Go to the Run tab of the solution\n     Click on the ‘Create Run Set Auto Run Configuration’ button as shown below.\n                     \n    \n     The Wizard is opened.\n                     \n    \n    \n    General Options Tab\n    \n                      \n    \n    Download/ Update Solution from source control\n    \n    Note:- This option is disabled if the solution is not downloaded from the source control repository.\n    It is enabled and checked if the solution is from the source control repository.\n    \n    In case checked, Ginger Solution will be downloaded/updated from source control on the execution machine before the execution starts.\n    \n    Show Run Set execution window while running (on Windows only)\n    This is option is not selected by default. If a user wants to see the execution status in Ginger while the run set is run, then use this option.\n    It displays only the Ginger Run tab. The status of the Run set along with the Runners, Activities and Actions are displayed during the execution as shown below.\n    It is recommended to run without UI for compatibility and performance reasons, for that please keep this option unchecked.\n    \n    \n    Run Set Analyzer before execution\n    \n    This option is selected by default. It helps in finding any critical/high design issues in the Business Flow which might impact the execution. In such a case, the execution is not started until the issues are fixed by the user.\n    When this option is unchecked, all the design issues are ignored, and execution starts without any checks.\n    \n    \n    Configurations Type Tab\n    \n                     \n    \n    Config\n    This option is used to create a config file which is used to execute a run set.\n    It contains the details like the path of the solution, environment name to be used, the Analyzer to be run or not, the run set name and to show the Ginger window or not when execution is going on.\n    \n    The file name and the path can be edited by the user.\n    The default path is the path of the RunsetShortCuts folder inside the solution.\n    \n    Dynamic\n    The dynamic config file is supported in JSON and XML format, it is recommended to use the JSON format which supports much more flexible configurations.\n           \n    \n          \n    \n    JSON Dynamic file supports 2 main modes:\n    Existing Run Set execution configurations- User can specify how exactly an existing Run set will be executed by manipulating it:\n    Runners execution configuration such as Parallel/Sequential, if to stop on failure or not, etc.\n    Applications-Agents mapping- set different Agent than configured on Ginger\n    Change selected Environment/s\n    Business Flows Active flag for disabling some of the Business Flows\n    Business Flow Input values- can define which value will be set to each input, including Output Values configuration\n    Run set Operations configurations manipulation (currently only Mail Report operation changes is supported)\n    On run time from CLI, Ginger will load the existing Run set, then will manipulate it according to the JSON configurations and then will execute the manipulated Run set.\n    Changes are not been saved to the Run set and have been used only during execution.\n    Note: JSON should include only the nodes of the items (Runners/Business Flows/etc.) which need to be modified on the Run set before execution starts.\n    \n    Sample existing Run set manipulation JSON:\n    \n    {\n    \"SolutionScmDetails\": {\n    \"SCMType\":

Generally, it's populated automatically when the path is in Program Files.\n    \n    GingerConsole.dll (Windows/Linux/Mac in case solution is compatible)\n    This option is used when a run set is to be run on a Linux/ Mac machine.\n    This DLL file can also be used to run on Windows.\n    When using in Linux/Mac, the actions in the run set should be compatible with Linux.\n    The Ginger.dll should also be available on the machine.\n    \n    The shortcut can be created on the Desktop or in the desired Folder by clicking the Folder option.\n    The Browse button is displayed to select the

IntroductionWeb API SOAP & Web API REST Actions support the following features:Security – ability to use certificates provided by a userAuthorization - currently added Basic authorization method using username and password.. Agent Configuration Create a new agent and select platform and driver as WebService.Go to Configurations-> Agents and click on the + button. In the Agent Wizard, enter the Name and select ‘WebServices’ in the Platform type.                      2. Configure relevant fields:SaveRequestXML, SaveResponseXML – setting Value to true will save the request files being sent and received responsesSaveXMLDirectoryPath – The path where all requests and response will be saved                                3. Test Agent – click on the ‘Test Agent Configurations’ button to make sure all the settings are correct.Make sure connection is successful:  How to configure Action            2.1 Pre-requisite A Solution should be created with the WebServices Platform.Soap UI 5.0.0 or above should be installed on the machine.SoapUI Project XML should be availableString for validation is required to verify the output if needed.                                          2.2 Action Operation                      Double click on the Business flow. In the Activity Actions, click on the ‘Add New’ button                                  In the ‘Platform Actions’ tab, select the ‘SoapUI Wrapper Action’ then Double click on the action row you selected/highlighted And it will automatically be added                                                The below screen should be displayed.  ‘XML File Location:’ use the Browse button to give the soapUI project XML file.The ‘Import XML file to Solution folder’ is used to copy the file to the Ginger Solution folder. There is an option to Add Respond XML Nodes to the Output Values.Checkbox “Ignore Report XML validation” is by default unchecked, the process will check if all the return test steps statuses are “OK” otherwise the action will be failed, if you don’t want the process to fail the action based on the statuses, please check this check box. By default, the process will run all test steps that exist on this project XML. If you want to narrow your test scope or if you need to configure test case properties please select test suite and test case, if the combo boxes are empty please press the refresh button                  From any ‘…’ the user can reach the value expression editor screen and parameterize the inputs:                Once Test Case selected the “Configure Test Case Properties” become enabled, Click it if you need to configure test case properties or place holder which will be replaced by the process on runtime  Once “Configure Test Case Properties” checked, the Radio selection and test case properties grid will become visible to the screen with all the relevant properties related to this test case, fill the ones you need and then delete all the rest (not mandatory), if you need placeholders instead so please click on Placeholders radio button and add the placeholders you need to replace on runtime.                   Entering any field from the below screenshot will replace the default value inside the project XML on runtime.                 In the screenshot below you can see the required fieldsEndpoint URL – this is the ‘endpoint ‘ URL where the request is being sent (same as in SOAP UI)If custom network credentials are required to access the endpoint URL (for example Username = so, Password=sa), a radio button  can be marked as ‘Custom’ and then 3 additional fields will be visible allowing the user to populate: username, password, and domain SOAP Action – This allows customizing the Action header in the request (if required, or can be used to identify different actions or index them).‘Do not Fail Action on Bad Response’ - when a checkbox is marked no validation will be done on the response code (useful for negative testing).‘Request Headers’ – by clicking on the ‘+’ sign (#6) the user can add a field that is required in the request e.g. token, in the case of adding a token the values should be as follows:Header = ‘Token’ (or as required per specifications).Value  =  the token value .                                If you need to configure the system, global, or project properties you shell do it in the below grids.                  Run Action.After running the action “Open Execution Output Directory” button will become enabled, click it if you want to see all the generated output files.

conversion to use the POM object\n    \n    Some troubleshooting tips\n     \n     \n     \n     \n    Purpose\n     The purpose of adding an Actions Convertor is to allow users to automatically convert their obsolete flows containing redundant \n     actions to new flows, also it provides the ability to convert to new actions using the POM objects.\n    \n     In this document, we’ll consider the example of conversion of obsolete ASCF Driver-based flows to Java Driver-based flows. There \n     could be more such scenarios in the future but for simplicity in understanding, we will take the example of conversion of obsolete \n      ASCF flows to Java Driver.\n     Since ASCF Driver is no longer supported by Ginger and users are highly recommended to switch to Java Driver for automation, \n     the ASCF/GTB Converter will facilitate the users to automatically convert their obsolete ASCF Driver-based actions to Java Driver- \n     based ones thus, minimizing the manual effort to a great extent.\n     \n     \n    Understanding the Actions Convertor\n     The Actions Conversion window consists of mainly three sections:\n    \n    Name of Activities in the Business Flow,\n    Convertible Action Types and,\n    Conversion Configurations\n     \n     Name of Activities in the Business Flow\n    This section lists out all the activities present in the selected Business Flow regardless they are active or inactive.\n    The user needs to select the activities that he wants to convert from the grid and then, click on the View Convertible Action Types buttons.\n     \n    Convertible Action Types\n    This section enlists all the types of actions present in the selected activity by the user. The action types are shown in a grid along with their Source Activities, which are the parent activities that contain that specific type of action in the activity.\n    The users can also view the Count of the action types in the selected activity i.e. number of occurrences of the action types in this activity along with their parent activities.\n    Finally, we have the Target Action Type that states the action type of the newly converted actions after the conversion is done.\n      ‎\n    Conversion Configurations\n    In this section, the users can do the configuration settings for the conversion. The users can choose whether they want to add the newly converted actions to a New Activity or the Same Activity i.e. the parent activity to which the obsolete action belongs to, also it provides the ability to convert to new actions using the POM objects user can select the existing POM object.\n    The users can also set a default Target Application (TA) for the modified activities by selecting the respective TA from a list of available TAs that are present in the selected Business Flow.\n     \n    In case the flow doesn’t have the required TA (in this case, a Java platform-based) then, the user can simply minimize the Actions Flow Conversion window and add the required TA to the flow from the Solution tab. Once added successfully, the user can switch back to the Actions Conversion window and click on the Refresh button () and the newly added TA will be shown in the list of TAs.\n    The user can choose the TA from the dropdown list and then, click on the Convert button and the newly converted actions will be added to a new activity or the same parent activity, depending on the selection made by the user.\n     \n    NOTE: It’s recommended to add the newly converted actions to a New Activity rather than the Same Activity because the new actions will need mapping to a different TA, in this case, a Java Driver-based TA.\n    Therefore, in a new activity, it is simpler to configure a new TA, in this case, a Java Driver-based TA. Whereas, if we choose to add new actions to the same activity that is already mapped to an ASCF Driver-based TA, this will result in a conflict here. Although the conflict can be resolved manually by the user, it will be easier for him/her in case of a new activity.\n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n               \n            \n          \n          \n            \n               \n              \n              \n               \n              POM Selection window\n            \n          \n          \n            \n               \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n     \n    Figure 1 – Actions Conversion window\n     \n     \n     \n    How to use the Actions Convertor?\n                  Double click on the Business Flow to get to the page as shown below.\n                  Click on the Extra options button and select Convert Legacy Business Flow Actions into New Actions.\n    \n    Figure 2 – Actions Conversion button\n     \n     \n    Please follow the steps mentioned below:\n     \n    For example, below is a Business Flow, Web_RegressionTestingSuite, containing multiple activities from an older version.\n    Now as you can see below, the first activity consists of ‘Go to URL Action’ which is an old action.\n     \n    \n     \n                  Figure 3 – Displaying old Action\n     \n    Click on the ‘Convert Legacy Business Flow Actions into New Actions’ button under the Extra Operations.\n    \n     \n     \n    Actions Conversion wizard will be opened and will display the activities which contain legacy actions.\n    \n    Figure 6\n     \n    Now we can select the activities which we want to convert to new actions and click on the Next button, we will see a list of Convertible Actions Types along with their count listed next to their Source Activities and Target Action Type,\n    which states the Action Type to which the old action will be converted after the conversion is completed.\n     \n    \n    Figure 7\n     \n    As you can see above, the selected activity consists of:\n     \n    1 Goto URL Action and,\n    2 Generic Element Actions\n     \n    These are the obsolete actions that will be converted to UIElement Actions.\n     \n    Now, we need to select the type of actions that we want to convert. We can also select all the enlisted Source Action Types too, the selections can be made depending on the requirement.\n    After selecting the Source Action Type, we need to decide the conversion configuration. This means that we need to decide whether we want to add newly converted action(s) to a New Activity or the Same Activity along\n    with the TA from the dropdown list.\n    Let’s consider both the scenarios separately here,\n     \n     \n     \n    New Activity with selected Target Application from the dropdown list\n     \n    In our example, we can select Web-App (or any other from dropdown) Target Application from the list and then, hit the Finish button, a new activity with the name, New - Automate Selenium Web, will be added to your business flow\n    just below the parent activity.\n    \n    Figure 8\n     \n    We can notice that the old activity has been marked as Inactive and the newly converted activity has been set as Active.\n     \n     \n    Same Activity with selected Target Application from the dropdown list\n     \n    Now, if we select Menu Item Action and will take the default Target Application as for the Target Application for selected activity from the list and then, hit the Convert button, we will see that the newly\n    converted Menu Item actions will be added to the same activity i.e. 2. Create Contact - Mandatory Information.\n     \n     \n    \n    Figure 9\n     \n    As we can see below that the newly converted Menu Item action into UIElement actions have been added right below the source action in the same activity. Also, the source actions have been marked as Inactive and the\n    new UIElement actions have been set as Active.\n     \n    \n    Figure 10\n     \n     \n     \n    Action conversion to use the POM object\n    As we can see below that, if we select the POM object to convert the legacy actions to use the POM object then we need to select the Menu Item Action as in the figure below, by selecting this we can convert the selected actions\n    to be converted to new actions which use the selected POM object. It tries to search the element (control in action) in the POM object and binds the new action with the element searched.\n     \n    \n    Figure 11\n     \n     \n    \n    Figure 12\n     \n     \n    Some troubleshooting tips\n    The Actions Convertor has been tested against a number of ASCF driver-based scenarios, with different business flows from different projects but there could be some edge-cases, where it may encounter issues while conversion.\n    In such cases, we advise the users to manually configure the obsolete action causing issues like mapping of values – Locate Value, Column Number or Column Title, etc. from the old action with the new UIElement Action.\n     \n    If the users still face issues with the convertor beyond their control, they are requested to share the scenarios with the Ginger Core Team so that they can look into it and fix it, as soon as possible to make the convertor more\n    robust and intuitive. Their feedback and suggestions are also welcome.\n     \n    It is recommended to choose a New Activity in the Conversion Configurations section to add the newly converted actions.\n     \n     \n

Dependency.\n     \n    Add Activity Variable Dependency\n    To Activate Variable Dependency, Click on the Activities-Variable Dependencies.\n    \n     \n    In the pop window, enable the checkbox Activities-Variable Dependencies Control. Click OK\n    \n     \n    Then click on Business Flow Variable and add one selection list variable.\n    \n     \n     \n    Open Edit page of variable selection list and add optional values in that list.\n    \n     \n    Repeat Step-a and open the Activities-Variables Dependencies page. Now we can see the new extra columns of variable selection list values followed by activities.\n    \n     \n    Here for variable selection list: a, selected activities are 1st and 2nd which means for variable value a, only those activities get executed. Like that, for variable selection list: b, selected activities are 1st and 3rd which means for variable value b, only those activities get executed.\n    \n     \n    By default variable selection list value is first means here selected value: a, so only 1st and 2nd activities gets executed and remaining are marked as skipped.\n    Let’s move towards the execution, click on Run Flow you can see execution like below.\n    \n     \n    Now open the edit page of the variable list and change the selected value: b.\n    \n     \n    Click on Run Flow and you can see only 1st and last activities get executed for value b.\n    \n     \n     \n    Add Action Variable Dependency\n    To Activate Variable Dependency, go to automate page and Click on the Actions-Variable Dependencies.\n    \n     \n     \n    In the pop window, enable checkbox Actions-Variables Dependencies Control. Click OK\n    \n     \n    Then click on Activity Variable and add one selection list variable.\n    \n     \n    Open Edit page of variable selection list and add optional values in that list.\n    \n     \n    Repeat Step-a and open the Actions-Variables Dependencies page. Now we can see the new extra columns of variable selection list values followed by actions.\n    \n            f.    Here for variable selection list: Chrome, selected actions are 1st and 2nd which means for variable value Chrome, only those actions get\n             executed. Like that, for variable selection list: Firefox, selected activities are 3rd and 4th which means for variable value Firefox, only those             actions gets executed.\n    \n     \n         g.   By default variable selection list value is first means here selected value: Chrome, so only 1st and 2nd actions get executed and remaining          are marked as skipped.\n            Let’s move towards the execution, click on Run Activity you can see activity execution like below.\n    \n     \n        h.   Now open the edit page of the variable list and change the selected value: Firefox.\n    \n     \n          i.  Click on Run Activity and you can see only 3rd and 4th actions get executed for value Firefox.\n    \n     \n     \n

 \n    \n      ‎\n    Description\n    This guide will explain how you can build automation flow for mobile applications using Ginger flow creation tools.\n     \n    Pre-requisite\n    Configured Mobile Target Application\n    Configured Business Flow which mapped to the Mobile Target Application\n    Configured and working mobile Agent\n    Mobile native/hybrid/web application to automate\n     \n    Start Mobile Agent\n    Follow below steps for starting the Mobile Agent:\n    Add Business Flow and add the Mobile target application to it\n    Shift to Automate page for the specific Business Flow\n    Select the added Appium Agent to be mapped to the Mobile Target Application\n    Start the Agent by clicking on the “Start” button\n    Mobile device window will launch (unless disabled on the Agent configurations) and show the device loading and then it screenshots\n     \n    \n    \n     \n     \n    Add Device Control Actions to Automation Flow\n    By using the “Mobile Device Action” user can control the device or add device control actions to his automation flow, steps:\n    Open the “Add Actions” panel\n    Select “Actions Library”\n    Select “Platform Actions”/ ”Mobile Device Action”\n    Double click the Action for adding it to the selected Activity Actions list\n    Double click the Action to get into it “Operation Settings”\n    Select the operation to perform\n    Click on “Run Action”\n    The operation will be performed on the device and impact will be visible on the mobile device window\n    \n     \n    Create Flow using Explorer\n    The Explorer tool allows users to explore the current viewed mobile application page, select the element/control needed to be automated and attach proper action to it, by that, Action by Action, the user can build the automation flow.\n     \n    Launch Window Explorer\n    Follow the below steps for opening the Explorer tool:\n    \n      Make sure mobile Agent is started\n      Reach to the mobile application page you want to automate\n      Open the “Add Actions” panel\n      Select the “Explorer” option\n      Explorer tool will be opened inside the panel\n    \n    \n     \n    \n     \n    Select Element via Screenshot\n    The screenshot option is the easiest way to select an element to be automated, follow the below steps for using it:\n    Make sure the page to automate is loaded on the device\n    Refresh Explorer Screenshot by clicking on the “Refresh Page” button\n    Click on the “Screenshot” tab\n    Go over the screenshot image and Click on the element/control which you want to automate\n    After few seconds the explorer will identify the element control which mouse was pointing on and the element details will be loaded into the “Selected Element” section\n    Selected element also will be highlighted on the screenshot\n    \n     \n    Select Element via Page Source\n    Page Source will show the XML (for native/hybrid apps) and HTML (for Web apps) which behind the currently loaded page on the device, the user can select an element by picking one of the nodes, steps:\n    Make sure the page to automate is loaded on the device\n    Refresh Explorer Screenshot by clicking on the “Refresh Page” button\n    Click on the “Page Source” tab\n    Review the loaded XML/HTML\n    Select the node related to the control you want to automate\n    Details of the selected control will be loaded into the “Selected Element” section\n     \n    \n     \n    Select Element via Grid View\n    Grid View will show the list of elements/controls that exist on the loaded application page on the device for the user to select from, steps:\n    Make sure the page to automate is loaded on the device\n    Refresh Explorer Screenshot by clicking on the “Refresh Page” button\n    Click on the “Grid View” tab\n    Filter Elements window will be shown for the user to select the type of UI controls to filter by, user should select which type of controls he requires and click “Search” (it is recommended to use the filter for faster controls scanning process)\n    All found elements/controls will be shown in a list\n    Select the required element from the list\n    The selected element details will be loaded into the “Selected Element” section\n     \n    \n     \n    \n     \n    Add Action for Selected Element\n    Once element/control was selected using the “Screenshot”/ “Page Source” / “Grid View” tools, all of its details will be shown in the “Selected Element” section.\n    Element details will be:\n    Properties- a collection of information details Ginger collected for the specifically selected element, like Type, size, location, etc.\n    Locators- list of locators Ginger captured to be used for locating this element in flow execution time\n    Action- will include the possible operations that can be performed on the selected element\n    Steps for adding Action for the specifically selected element:\n    Click on the Action tab\n    Select/set the proper locator and value to be used\n    Select the operation to be done\n    In case relevant, set the value to be used\n    Click on “Run” for testing the operation from the Explorer tool, the result of the execution will be shown on the “Execution Report” tab\n    In case operation performed as expected, click on the “Add” button for adding the operation for the specifically selected element into the list of currently selected Activity\n     \n    \n     \n    \n     \n    \n

Description\n                Any Unix-based actions can be performed by the Ginger tool.\n                 Any Simple Unix commands to customized scripts can be executed from Ginger.\n                 Free commands and Parameterized commands are available on Ginger.\n                Multiple Unix Environments can be configured on Ginger to conduct the same test like QA1, QA2 by Simply switching the environment tab on \n                the top.\n                 Multiple DBs can be configured and used for the same testing Purpose on Ginger.\n     \n    Recording Unix based Action\n     \n    Recording Unix based actions\n    \n     \n                   The above window will be opened upon launching the Unix agent, in this case, the Unix machine is configured with IP 10.122.113.194 which is                 a Rasp PI machine.\n    \n                   Once the Agent comes up, click on the Record button to start recording\n     \n                   \n                  \n     \n                  On the above window, it clearly shows what all the actions performed on the Unix window is been recorded as individual actions on a Ginger                    tool.\n    \n                 The same steps needed for testing Unix based projects can be recorded and executed on Ginger\n    \n                  We can set up a pre and post waiting time as needed on a Ginger tool\n    \n                  In case of developing customized scripts for the Project, the Output of each such script should have a pre-defined start and end display lined on                the output.\n    \n                 FTP files from and to services are as well available with all other Unix commands.\n    \n                The ginger tool as of now have pre-defined Unix Building block scripts for basic operations like, is file exist, move the file, copy a file, delete files\n    \n                There is no Ginger tool pre-defined experience are needed for using this tool\n    \n                The Interface is user friendly and look and feel exactly like a Unix Xterm or putty Unix window\n    \n                If multiple Unix servers need to be used to accomplish the testing can be achieved using the multiple server configuration.\n                The business flow will have the same sequences of commands on the same servers as Manual testing performed.\n    \n                Limitations\n               Unix session cannot be left ideal for more than 5 minutes, will terminate the connection at the backend\n    \n                When dealing with multiple servers, each unit of work on the server by server needs to be completed before going to another server as we do in              a real-world scenario.\n     \n    Unix based backend script execution in Ginger\n

  \n     \n     \n     \n    \n      ‎\n    Description\n            These steps will explain how to work with Ginger Java Driver on any Java application OMS, CRM, Java, and widgets (Web embedded in java                        application).\n             Java Agent offers:\n    \n                                  Automate Java Application\n                                  Automate Web Embedded Widgets\n    \n    Pre Requisites\n    Latest Ginger version.\n    JDK version 1.6_29 and up installed on the machine\n    Configure solution to work with Java Driver\n    Add Java Agent to the Solution\n    Right-click on Agents and Add a new Agent.\n    \n     \n    Add name and target platform type.\n    \n     \n     \n    Add Java to the target application.\n     \n    Click on the solution name.\n    \n     \n    Click on the business flow and verify that the target application is JavaApp.\n    \n     \n    Launch your Java application.\n    While using the launch java application action you will fire your java application and attach the Agent to the application.\n     \n    Verify activity target application\n    \n     \n     \n    Configure Java Launch application Action\n    This action will enable you to:\n    Launch java application and attach the agent for using java driver to automate your application.\n    Attach the agent to running the Java application.\n    launch your java application without attaching the agent (use if u are using other agents to automate your application)\n    \n    Add new action by clicking the add action button.\n    Move to the General action tab and select the “Launch Java application”.\n    \n     \n    Edit launch java application action.\n    \n     \n    Java Version Path – Used for selecting the path for JDK location, you can select the first option if the JDK is set in your environment variable or the second option if the JDK is located in a different location on the machine. In any case, JDK is a must to run this action.\n    Launch Java Application – check this option if you want both to launch the java application and attach the agent. You can also use this Action just for attaching the agent to an already running Java application by unchecking this section.\n    Java Application Path – Add the application location is you are using to run CRM, add the full domain location for the JNLP.\n    Use the “Add Parameter to Launch Application With” button if u need to launch your application with a parameter like a user name.\n     \n    \n     \n    Wait for Java Application Window – Add the title of the window that you are expecting to be open once your application is launched and the time to wait for it (sec).\n    Attach Ginger Java Agent – use this to attach the agent to the application, by default the location of the agent is located in the ginger folder. You can also change the port if 8888 is being used by a different program.\n    Notice:\n    Java Launch Action need to be on Separate Activity it can’t be with Other\n    Action, as u can see below activity 1 holed only one action in activity 2\n    \n    We will handle the Login window.\n    \n     \n     \n    Working with Java Agent on Java Application\n    Working with Window Explore\n    Window Explorer will enable you to identify objects on the screen, add locators (Xpath, id, etc.) for the object, and actions that can be done (set, get, validate, etc.).\n    Once the application is up and running you can start the agent and Window Explore\n    Start the Agent:\n    \n     \n    Start the Window Explore:\n    \n     \n     \n    Once Window Explore is up select the application window title that needs to work on.\n    \n     \n    Add switch window action to set the focus on the window we want to work on, once you will click on this button “Switch Window” action will be added to the activity.\n    \n     \n    Once you add the switch window action u can Edit it and add “Sync Time” which means how much time\n    To wait for the window to come up.\n     \n    \n     \n    You can also switch the view from tree View to Grid View by clicking on this Button.\n     \n    \n     \n     \n     \n    Working with Spy\n    Click on the spy icon\n     \n    \n     \n    Once Clicked on the spy button move your cursor to the element you want and press on Ctrl,\n    Once the element is found all details will be available.\n    For Example, if you want to work on the First Name text box:\n    \n     \n    Text box we want to work on, move your cursor to First name, and press on Ctrl.\n    Actions – these are all the actions that available for this control Set, get, Validate, etc...\n    Locators – this is how we are locating the element in this case we have ByName or by Xpath\n    We recommend working with Xpath.\n    Value – value to set on the text box.\n    Playback – once setting the value you can test the action.\n    Add to Activity – Add this Action to the flow in Ginger.\n    This is the way we are working with all elements, Drop Down list radio Button Check box tables, etc.\n     \n     \n    Working with Widgets (Web Embedded)\n    Widgets are Web pages that Embedded in CRM \\OMS running on the JExplore process,\n    We are handling it by injecting java scripts into the web page and that enables us to interact with the page.\n    \n    Open window explores refresh the window list and select the window where the web Page is embedded.\n     \n    \n     \n    Click on the switch window action and add it to the activity\n    \n     \n    To get the elements to window explore we need to inject the JS into the page\n    Click on Grid View.\n    \n     \n    In the search box type JE and find the Jexplorer object in the grid select locator as Xpath and\n    Add the action to the activity\n    \n    Once Done with all activities above you can start working with the spy\n    To add the actions.\n     \n    \n     \n    Activity that works with widgets action should be in this order\n    \n     \n    Appendix:\n    Working with IFRAME (Widgets)\n     There are web pages that the content of the page is inside IFRAME so to handle that\n     We need to add Switch Frame action.\n    Once we add the Switch window and JExplorer Actions we need to add the Switch Frame action\n     \n    \n     \n    This is how IFRAME activity IFRAME should be handled\n    \n     \n     \n    Working With GTB and Java Driver\n    Use Different Ports, verify that you are not using the same port on GTB and Java Driver\n    Check your GTB port in this case it is 9999\n     \n    \n     \n    So when you use launch java application action check that you are not using the same port\n    \n    \n    \n    On the java launch application action turn off the “show ginger Agent console” option.\n    \n    \n    \n    Use different activities for java Driver and GTB\n     \n     \n    Using Wait for Idle action on Java Application\n    Once we are adding Action like Click, we have the option to select wait for Idle,\n    Wait for Idle Enable you to set the interval and timeout to check if the application is done with processing all events and idle to proceed with the next actions.\n    \n     \n     \n    Using Smart Sync Action on Java Application\n    Smart Sync will help you sync between the Automation steps and the application\n    We have 2 types:\n    WaitUntilDisaper – set wait time and check until element disappears.\n    WaitUntilDisplay – set wait time and Check until an element is Displayed.\n    \n    Click on Add new Action.\n    From the list of actions select “Smart Sync Action”\n    \n     \n    Click on the window Explore Icon and Add your element\n    Set the Action Type.\n    Set Wait time.\n     \n    \n     \n     \n    Set Date of Birth on CRM screen using Java Driver\n     \n     While setting and Date-type field on the CRM, we need to configure our Edit Java Element Action as per the highlighted fields shown in the \n     screenshot below\n     \n                  \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n
