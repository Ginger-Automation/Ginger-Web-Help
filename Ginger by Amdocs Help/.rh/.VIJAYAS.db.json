you automate a small flow using GINGER.\n    Here we will see the steps on how we automate the flow of launching URL http://abeat.amdocs.com and logging in with some credentials.\n    Also, we will understand customizing the execution report as per our requirement.\n    \n    To create a solution click on the drop down as shown below and select ‘Create New Solution’ option.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    In the pop window, enter the name of the solution (as shown below) browse to the location of the folder where you wish to save your solution.\n    \n    \n    \n    Since we are automating a website flow select the application as “MywebApp” and platform as “WEB”. On click of create a solution is created successfully.\n    \n    This will load the solution as shown below.\n    \n    \n    \n    Go to the Configurations tab and click on Agents.\n    In the left panel, the agent is automatically created for the “MyWebApp”.\n    The default driver for WebApp application is Internet Explorer “SeleniumIE” and the driver type can be changed if needed using the drop down.\n    \n    \n    \n    Once the solution and agent are created, double click on the Business flow and it will take you to the automation area.\n    In this window, you will see various sections like Activities Group , Activity-Variables and Actions.\n    By default, Activity1 is added as shown below.\n    \n    \n    \n    Go back to the Business Flow by clicking the back arrow at the left top corner.\n    Click on the Variables tab, Business Flow variables are added here.\n    Click on the + sign to create a new variable which can be used in all the Activities within the Business Flow.\n    \n    \n    Here we will use the variable to give the name of the website which we intend to open as part of our automation flow.\n    Select the variable type from the list shown like in our case the website name will be variable string as highlighted in the list below. Click on Add Variable.\n    \n    \n    Variables gets added.\n    \n    \n    Double click on it to open it in Edit page.\n    Enter the name as “Website” and and the string value as http://abeat.amdocs.com since this is the URL we will open as part of automation as shown below.\n    \n    \n    Now we need to add action using the + sign in the action section. Actions are executables on various platforms.\n    First double click on the Business Flow to go to the Automate tab.\n    Then click on + button as shown below.\n    \n    \n    Click on the Actions Library as shown below\n    \n    \n    Platform specific actions are displayed here. Since we have chosen platform as website, web related actions will be displayed.\n    General Actions are not platform specific.\n    Since we want to launch a website in this URL, we will select “Browser Action” and click on the arrow button as shown below.\n    \n    \n    Double click on the added action to open it in edit mode.\n    Select the ‘Operation Type’ as ‘Goto URL’\n    \n    \n    Since we have assigned the website name in a variable we will browse that variable name in the URL textbox. For this click on “…” button near the URL textbox as shown below.\n    Double click the ‘Website’ variable on the left pane.
