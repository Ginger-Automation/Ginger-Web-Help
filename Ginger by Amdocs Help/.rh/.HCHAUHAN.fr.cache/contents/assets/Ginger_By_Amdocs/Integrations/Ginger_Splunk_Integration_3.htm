    Description
     Splunk is the tool to monitor different infrastructure performances, troubleshoot issues, create dashboards, create reports and alerts easily. 
     It is a complete tool for managing any system with all the logs being stored dynamically. Splunk can generate a variety of reports like graphs,  
     pie charts, bar charts, etc. 
                        Ginger has the capability of running multiple flows and generating detail reports although by integrating Ginger with Splunk, we can expand                           the capabilities of Ginger to generate variety of report by sending Execution JSON Data to Splunk. 
     
    Pre Requisites
    Prerequisites are:
    Splunk API details like endpoint url, authorization, body etc.
    Ginger Version (Beta 3.7.1 or above)
