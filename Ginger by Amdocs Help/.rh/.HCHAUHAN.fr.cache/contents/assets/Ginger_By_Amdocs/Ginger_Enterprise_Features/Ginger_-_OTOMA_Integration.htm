  Ginger - OTOMA Integration
   
  Introduction
  Ginger: Ginger is code less Automation Application. Ginger supports automation of multiple platforms like Web, Web services (API), Java, Unix,  Windows, Power Builder, Mainframe, DOS & Mobile.
   
  OTOMA: OTOMA is Model Based Testing (MBT) application. OTOMA is used to create Use Case - design of test case (using imported shared repository activities of Ginger in OTOMA) & create and execute Test Suite (Test Suite can contain one or more use cases)
   
  Note: To implement this Enterprise Feature in your project, please contact Ginger Team Focal or you can send email to ginger@amdocs.com

  1. Ginger - OTOMA Integration configuration & Test Suite Execution Overview
  Please see below steps diagram and details:
  Note:  All DB configuration (Ginger Parser & OTOMA) & OTOMA application setup will be handled by Ginger Support Team.
  (In below diagram step#3 & step#5 will be handled by Ginger Support Team)

  2. Use Case Creation & Test Suite Execution
  Steps:
   
  Step 1. Open Ginger and create a solution (Web, WebServices etc. ) and do followings and Save all changes:
   
    a. Create Activities (and use activity variables only if required) and publish these actvities (and publish variables)
   
  
  ntralized Ex
  ecution Logge
    b. Add activities into Shared Repository
  r Settings’ configuration
  
   
  
   
    c. Publish Agents & Environment 
   
  
  
   
    d. Configure the 'Repots - Centralized Execution Logger Settings’. Enter End Point URL of your respective project
   
  
   
  Step 2. Uplaod or push your solution to the GIT 
   
  Step 3. Share your GIT Repo URL, Login Name and Password Token with Ginger Support Team for the DB configurations 
   
  Step 4. Login to OTOMA UI and Create a new release 
  (Go to Setup --> Create new release) 
   
  
   
  Fill all relevents filed's value and click on 'Next' button
   
  
   
  Select the 'Create an empty release' option and clcik on 'Create' button
   
  
   
  
   
  
  Step 5. Please share the Release Name with Ginger Support Team for DB configurations
   
  Step 6.   Login to OTOMA GUI and do the followings: 
    a. Import Topolgy into OTOMA: This step will import all published shared activities (or interfaces) of Ginger (along with all published activity variables (or Elements)) into OTOMA
   
  
    b.  
   
   
   
   
  
  3. Web Services (API) Application Use Case creation & Test Suite Execution
  Note: Consumer Application concept is being used in case of 'WebService' (API) target application.
  Target Application (Called System) & Consumer Application (Calling System)
  Consumer Application concept is being used in case of 'WebService' (API) target application.
  Target Application is where action needs to be performed
  Consumer Application is the system which is going to consume or call the target application.
   
  Example 1: Let say user is defining in Ginger as follows:
      Target Application :  System 'A' (WebServices)
      Consumer :  System 'B' (Web)
      It means :  System 'B' is consuming System 'A'  i.e.  user is working on 
      System 'B' and System 'B' is calling System 'A' API
   
   Example 2: User is working on CRM and any action of CRM is Calling OMS API (requesting any data from OMS), in this case unser need to define in Ginger as follows: 
      Target Application is 'OMS'
      Consumer is 'CRM'
      It means:  
                   CRM ---- Send Request---->  OMS
                   OMS ---- Recieve Response ---> CRM
    
  Web Services (API) Application Use Case creation & Test Suite Execution
