    Different 'Operation Type' of 'Browser Action':
     1) Block URLs & Unblock URLs using 'Browser Action' in Ginger (Operation Type: Set Blocked Urls & Unblock Urls)
    Introduction
    There are use cases where while performing web application testing, some specific URLs need to be blocked in browser, so that unwanted environment specific content should be blocked and should not be rendered on web page. Earlier this was not possible to block some URLs through Ginger web driver, and as part of this feature its enabled.
    Use Case – 
                There was a requirement from one of the accounts to block browser from sending web request to some specific URL, so that contents on the web page are rendered correctly after reaching some point in web application flow in a web browser session. And if the web request is not blocked the web page would render the distorted content which is not readable at all. The web request content which needed to be blocked was also relevant, but it was for some specific location and from test environment that was not supposed to be requested. Selenium supports blocking multiple URLs or domains at a time in same browser session.
    So below were the steps user had to follow to perform the testing:
    
      Launch the browser and visit the expected URL.
      Perform login. 
      Reach to specific web page in the flow (with distorted web page content)
      Block the required URL/URLs from using Dev tools manually. 
      Manually refresh the web page.
       Now user would see the web page content rendered properly.
    
    
     
    
    
     1. Block URLs can be given in Ginger Browser action (Operation Type: Set Blocked Urls)
    To block specific URLs following modifications can be done in existing business flow, after reaching to point in the flow.
    
      Add another “Browser Action”
      Select Operation Type as “Set Blocked Urls”
      After selecting the operation type as above, Ginger asks for list of URLs to be blocked.
      Multiple URLs can be specified using comma separated values.
      It can accept the list of URLs as inline value or it can also accept through variable
      Once the URLs are specified and executing the action, Ginger adds the URLs to in Browser’s blocked URLs list 
      This feature is supported only in Chromium based browsers i.e. Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge 
    
       
    
    
     2. Unblock URLs (Operation Type: Unblock Urls)
    URLs can be unblocked easily using another newly added operation type in Browser action called “Unblock Urls”. This will Unblock all previously blocked URLs, blocked user “Set Blocked URLs” operation type.
    
    
     
    
    
    
     2) Ginger - Network Logs Filtering (Operation Type: Start Monitoring Network Logs, Stop Monitoring Network Logs & Get Network Logs)
    Introduction: Using Network logs, we can track all the requests and responses from browser to analyze them. To enhance this feature, we have added better filtering capability based on like comparison. User can monitor 'Specefic URLs' as well.
    
    Please follow below steps to use Network Logs Feature:
    
     1. Add Browser Action to 'Start Monitoring Network Logs' and give Filters as below
     Before you start your actual Browser related activities, please add the first action Start Network Monitoring logs.
            Please add a Browser Action and select Start Monitoring Network Logs in Operation type as shown in below Screenshot.
     One can use hard coded value as filter or one can use Value Expression editor to populate the Filter value using different kind of variables available in Ginger, e.g., Business Flow Variable, Activity Variable, Global Variable, Environment Parameters.
     e.g.,
            Here user wants to track the Network logs for URL containing c8ea6ef96f4556409674bd5dbb3ee472 ID
             URL: https://amdocsprodmain.service-now.com/one_portal?id=aop_sc_cat_item&sys_id=c8ea6ef96f4556409674bd5dbb3ee472
     Filter: c8ea6ef96f4556409674bd5dbb3ee472
    
            
     2. Use Get Network Logs action during runtime to fetch the Network logs processed till the time the action is executed
          Steps:
    
     a) Add Browser action and select Operation Type as Get Network Logs as shown in screenshot
                     
    
    
     b) Add Browser action and select Operation Type as Get Network Logs as shown in screenshot
    
    3. Add Browser action and select Operation Type as Get Network Logs as shown in screenshot
        Add a browser action and select Stop Monitoring Network Logs operation type.
    
                    
    3) Switch to Shadow DOM (Operation Type: Switch To Shadow DOM)
              In order to Locate Element of a shadow DOM, you need to first switch to the required Shadow DOM, to do this you must use the ‘Switch To Shadow DOM’ operation.  
     In the locate By and Locate Value inputs enter the parent of the shadow root. 
     For e.g., in the below page to switch to shadow DOM. The locate by and locate value of ‘smart-ui-menu’ tag should be entered.
       
    
    
    4. Switch to Default DOM (Operation Type: Switch To Default DOM)
        In case you are inside a Shadow DOM and you need to move out of it to the Default DOM (which does not have any access to any shadow DOM present on the page), you must use the ‘Switch To Default DOM’ operation.
